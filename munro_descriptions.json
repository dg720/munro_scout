    "summary": "The east side of Drumochter pass is bounded by a steeply rising moor, riven by gullies. Suprisingly given its unimpressive appearance, there are two Munros on the plateau above. The hills themselves lack interest but this walk gives a real feeling of space. The tops are the haunt of dotterel and ptarmigan.",
    "description": "Park in layby 87, on the west side of the A9 about three quarters of a kilometre south of the Dalwhinnie turning. Cross the road (very carefully!) and head a short way along the verge to the north before going through a gate onto a vehicle track, passing under the pylons. and over the construction tracks for the new Beauly-Denny powerline. The hill track heads briefly north but soon bends to the right and begins to ascend the moor, with good views across the pass to A'Mharconaich and Geal Chàrn.\n\nContinue the easy ascent which keeps to the wide slope between two gullies. Nearing the plateau the track reaches an old quarry; the map is somewhat misleading in that this consists only of a shallow depression and a few blocks of quartz, and could be missed entirely when under snow. Continue on the track beyond the quarry, taking the left fork onto the broad ridge leading northeast. There is a line of fenceposts along here which may help navigation in mist. After a little under two kilometres the track is left as the ridge and fence bend to the right.\n\nA shallow depression is crossed before the final rise; this is very boggy underfoot unless it is frozen. Beyond, continue up the easy slope to the tiny cairn at the summit of Càrn na Caim. At 941 metres this is a Munro, and its position on the edge of the plateau makes it a good viewpoint. The dome of Meall Chuaich is in the foreground ahead, but the view extends across much of Badenoch to the Monadhliath, as well as across to the Cairngorms to the east and over range upon range to the west.\n\nReturn across the boggy bealach and back along the landrover track to where the plateau was initally reached, this time continuing south rather than returning to the 'quarry'. A track leads on at first, crossing a couple of dips in the plateau.\n\nBeyond the cairn on A'Buidheanach the plateau drops steeply, so it is better to bear left downhill a little before reaching this point to join a path skirting this lump. Another soggy bealach is crossed before a boggy path begins the ascent beyond, a little to the right of a small stream. The slope eases off as another plateau is reached, a short distance from the minor top of A'Buidheanach Mhor.\n\nHead southwest and then south for a short distance to reach the trig point of A'Buidheanach Bheag, the second Munro of the day at 936 metres. Truly dedicated baggers may notice on the map that there is a second summit at 936 about 500 metres to the west; it is impossible to say which is the true Munro summit but this second contender has no cairn and few visitors.\n\nOnce you are satisfied, return over all the bumps and dips back to the top of the landrover track near the 'quarry' for the easiest descent back to Drumochter.",

    "summary": "These rewarding Munros offer a fine outing with superb views over Loch Fannich, An Teallach and the Fisherfield. The ridges offer fine walking, but the descent route is steep and rough and there is a great deal of boggy terrain lower down.",
    "description": "Park at the parking area just past the forestry plantations and gated, signed track off the A832 to the south west of Braemore junction. From the parking area walk back along the road for 20 metres until you reach the track leading to Loch a Bhraoin; it is signed for long distance routes to Kinlochewe and Loch Fannich. Go past the barrier and along the track, with views of the mountains ahead. Soon a gate is reached and new paths head off to the left and right - turn left here, following a path which leads through the forestry and then down to a bridge over the outflow of the loch.\n\nFollow the stalker's path on the other side of the bank for a very short distance. As you reach the foot of the ridge heading up to Tomain Coinich turn right onto a boggy path heading straight up the slope of Leitir Fhearna, the nose of the ridge. From here the slope higher up looks rocky but it presents no difficulties apart from wet ground; the path easily negotiates the rocky sections.\n\nOnce past the rocky part the ridge flattens and there is a plateau riven with peat gullies. Avoid the worst of the peat by following the path round the right edge to reach the grassier ridge beyond. This gives a gentle and enjoyable climb, with good views of the corries in front of the Munros on either side. Do not be tempted to stay on the path traversing the right hand side of the ridge, this path eventually leads to the col between Toman Coinich and A Chailleach across a very steep and rocky final slope; it is better to follow the crest of ridge straight to the summit of Toman Coinich.\n\nFrom the summit of Toman Coinich there are fine views down to Loch Fannich and the surrounding hills. Follow the south easterly broad ridge down to the col, crossing wide bare steps caused by glaciation in the last ice age. From the col it is a straightforward climb to Sgùrr Breac. The true summit is not the first cairn on the little rise but is a couple of hundred metres further east atop of flat plateau, giving little impression of the cliffs to the north. This is the first Munro of the day, at 1000 metres.\n\nRetrace your steps to Tomain Coinich and then descend the indistinct ridge to the bealach opposite before climbing steadily up the grassy and much more well defined and enjoyable ridge up the far side; there are great views down the cliffs on the right side down to Loch Toll an Lochain in the corrie floor.\n\nKeep following the ridge as it flattens off at the junction with Sròn an Goibhre ridge (most easily identified by the old fence post stumps going off down the slope to the right). Here bear left, following the path to reach the summit of A Chailleach, the second Munro of the day, and a superb viewpoint both over Loch Fannich and into the remote peaks of the Fisherfield Forest.\n\nTo find the descent route return north east to where the fence posts led off and start descending the ridge of Sròn na Goibhre (no path). The descent is fairly steep to start with and then becomes gentle as it follows the spur. The ridge climbs slightly, crossing a rocky-knoll like summit.\n\nA couple of hundred metres beyond these is the best place to begin the very steep descent down the right flank of the ridge to the coire near the outflow of Loch Toll an Lochain. The slope is mostly steep grass and bog with some greasy boulders, but must be tackled to avoid the crags at the termination of the ridge to the north. Once down in the corrie turn left alongside the burn, crossing it as soon as possible. Further on ground steepens and the stream cascades into a ravine with a series of waterfalls; this is negotiated with a descending traverse to the right.\n\nBeyond the waterfalls, continue heading downhill diagonally towards Loch a Bhraoin. Note a fine sheepfold off to the left. Eventually a very boggy and faint ATV track can be picked up, aiming for the far corner of a fenced area. Pass this corner and continue to the shores of Loch a' Bhroain. Now follow the very rough and boggy track back to the bridge at the outflow of the loch. Cross this to return to the A832 by the outward route.",

    "summary": "This long hillwalk includes ascents of three of the four Monadh Liath Munros. The hills themselves are undistinguished (particularly Càrn Sgulain), but Càrn Dearg has a feeling of remoteness and the long trek across the plateau from this peak to the others gives a feeling of great space, given favourable weather.",
    "description": "Park at the end of the minor road leading from Newtonmore into Glen Banchor. This is an attractive, surprisingly wild little glen given its position close to the town. Continue on foot along the track up the glen, almost immediately crossing the bridge over the Allt a Chaorainn. The track leads past a plantation and passes close to the site of a deserted township. Just before the house and bridge over the Allt Fionndrigh, take the track which bends off to the right. This leads up into Gleann Fiondrigh, which lacks the open aspect of Glen Banchor, being hemmed in by the foothills of the Monadhliath.\n\nContinue on the track up Gleann Fionndrigh until peters out into a boggy ATV track. Bear left from here to head down to a footbridge over the Allt Fhionndrigh. Follow the ATV track as it now heads southwest up towards a featureless bealach above the west side of the glen, becoming very boggy underfoot. On the wide bealach the route forks - ATV tracks swing both left and uphill to the right. Take the latter, then fork left part way up the slope.\n\nThe very boggy ATV tracks (which may not always be distinct) come closer to the Allt Ballach in upper Gleann Ballach, before rising gently up the eastern side of the glen. The summit of Càrn Dearg rises impressively atop a crag on the opposite side of the glen. As the head of Gleann Ballach is reached the route peters out towards the boggy bowl at the head of the glen.\n\nHere a wide grassy ramp enables an easier climb to the southwest, avoiding coming close to any crags. As height is gained the going becomes dry at last, and an improving path heads up onto the ridge a short distance north of the summit of Càrn Dearg. Continue along the edge to reach the summit cairn, which at 945 metres is the highest of the Monadhliath; the position of the cairn on the edge of the steep drop to Gleann Ballach ensures it is also the finest peak of the range.\n\nRetrace your steps briefly but then continue northwards onto the stony ground around the summit of Càrn Ban. North and west from here stretches the vast, empty and almost featureless plateau of the Monadhliath, as little visited as any ground in Britain. Our onward route is generally northeast, passing over the top of Càrn Ballach and then reaching Meall na Creughaich; all the time the ground underfoot becomes less stony and boggier. Another three kilometres from here, now heading eastwards, is Càrn Sgulain, the second of the day's Munros, and one of the most featureless on Sir Hugh's list.\n\nFinding the route all across the plateau from Càrn Ban to this Munro would be difficult indeed in bad visibility but a line of old metal fenceposts offers guidance. There is little to detain you on Càrn Sgulain's summit, which could be either a small cairn or a larger one slightly further on, so return a short distance southwest to the last bealach, then bearing south-southwest to cross the Allt Cuil na Caillich.\n\nThis stream has cut a steep little 'v'-shaped valley into the plateau, so heading this way is necessary to avoid the steepest drop down to it. Once across the stream and above the steep bank beyond, continue easily southeast to the third Munro, A'Chailleach.\n\nThis is a popular destination in its own right for walkers staying at Newtonmore, and the summit is marked by a huge cairn (visible for miles around across Badenoch), with a windshelter set into one side. The descent route has the benefit of a rough path for much of the way. Begin by heading south; the ascent eventually becomes more gradually and crosses a boggy area. Eventually it descends southeast near a burn into the glen, with great views down towards Newtonmore.\n\nThree-quarters of the way down you'll pass a little corrugated iron hut which offers very rough shelter on a wild day. Further down it is necessary to cross the Allt a'Chaorainn to reach a better path on the far side; this is usually possible using stones and boulders unless in spate (there's a footbridge a short distance downstream). Follow the path down the far side, which almost immediately becomes a track. This leads directly down the glen, passing the forestry plantations at its foot to return directly to the start.",

    "description": "Park in the layby on the north side of the A87, just over a kilometre east of the Cluanie Inn. Walk east for a short distance along the road to the start of the signposted path through the An Caorann Mòr (about a kilometre and a half east of the Cluanie Inn). Walk up the first steep section of track; after around 50m look out for a faint path heading off on the right. From here the route makes an unrelenting and direct climb up the steep grassy slopes to the northeast. The angle relents at about 750m where you emerge on the south ridge of A'Chralaig.\n\nTurn left along the ridge, which climbs in stages and becomes better defined as height is gained. At about 1000m the ridge turns northwest and leads easily to the massive and well-built cairn on the summit of A' Chralaig (which rather puzzingly means The Basket). There is a commanding view of the whole area, with Loch Cluanie being seen full length. The ridge now briefly leads northwards before a steeper rocky descent northwest and a northerly continuation down to a bealacb.\n\nFrom the dip on the ridge, continue still with a clear path, crossing the 1008m top where it turns once more to the right to reach another col. From here the ridge goes north once more, and becomes very narrow. For part of the way the ridge crest is broken into a series of rocky towers; keen and able scramblers might cross these, but most walkers will use the clear bypass path which avoids them to the right before crossing back over the ridge and avoiding the last section to the left. Even the bypass path has one short rocky step but this shouldn't give most hillwalkers any difficulty.\n\nThe summit of Mullach Fraoch-Choire is a short distance beyond the difficulties. The second Munro of the day at 1102 metres has great views over the wilds at the head of Glen Affric though most walkers will most enjoy looking back along the ridge to A'Chralaig. From here, return back down the difficult section of ridge or bypass path, before leaving the ridge to the right at the col before the 1008 metre top. The descent is on a path down steep scree at first but the grassy upper reaches of Coire Odhar are soon reached.\n\nContinue the descent down Coire Odhar; it is possible to bear left slightly southwest lower down to shorten the walk back. The path through the Glen is reached at its foot; turn left along it and climb towards the low pass ahead. The pass itself is very boggy underfoot; aim for the start of the landrover track in the An Caorann Mòr which relieves the tedious going. Continue down this track to return to the start.",

    "description": "Turn off the A87 at Morvich, and park at the National Trust for Scotland Morvich countryside centre, opposite Morvich Caravan Club site. Start by walking along the continuation of the road, then crossing the bridge at Innichro at its end. Keep ahead on the track on the far side before looking out for a signed path which heads off right after 60m. The path passes through a couple of gates and eventually continues up the glen above the Abhainn Chonaig.\n\nAfter a couple of kilometres keep right at a fork. For the most part the path keeps well above the river as it heads up the increasingly wild glen. The Allt a Choire Chaoil can usually be crossed on boulders, though it may be difficult or dangerous in spate.\n\nThe stalkers path then climbs several zigzags en route for the Bealach an Sgairne. Ignore the path off to the right (which leads to Beinn Fhada), and continue on the main path which cuts dramatically across the steep hillside before continuing the climb up to the pass.\n\nThe Bealach na Sgairne is marked by a large cairn and has a great view back down Gleann Choinneachain. The narrow hill path continuing onto A'Ghlas-bheinn climbs north from here; it keeps left to avoid the crags just above the pass before cutting back up to the ridge. The ill-defined ridge climbs steeply at first, soon giving great views back towards Beinn Fhada. It continues past a small lochan and over a series of rocky undulations.\n\nThere are several false summits before the small summit cairn finally is reached, perched atop some slabby rocks. A Ghlas-bheinn is a Munro at 918m, and has stunning views, especially towards the coast and Skye.\n\nThe easiest descent route is to retrace steps, or you could descend via the west ridge, but the route described here enables a visit to the made to the Falls of Glomach - recommended if you have the energy and have not visited them previously. Descend with care northwards from the summit, taking care to avoid broken crags (there's a grassy gully to the left).\n\nOnce down the steep section the easiest going is to traverse the moorland to the left of the ridgeline, rather than climbing over the knobbly peaks. The going is pathless and navigation requires care, keeping the steep ground rising up on your right. Once flatter ground is reached west of Meall Dubh, another steeper descent leads down to the Bealach na Sroine, where the clear path to the Falls of Glomach is joined.\n\nTo visit the falls turn right along the path, which undulates a little before beginning a descent towards the unseen gorge of the Falls of Glomach ahead. A sign indicates that it is dangerous to proceed further, but most visitors will continue very carefully down to a ledge which has a terrific view of the great falls, where the Allt a'Ghlomaich tumbles in two great leaps down into an awesome gorge. Return back up the path to the Bealach na Sroine.\n\nThis time continue on the main path which descends the right hand side of the valley to reach the top of the forestry plantations. Cross the bridge and follow the track down the east side of the river. At the next fork, keep right and the track crosses back over the river. Another track soon joins in from the right. Keep left at the next fork and then turn right through a gate into an open area, crossed by a path. As you comes near the river turn left to another gate - pass through and then descend a path left to reach and cross a footbridge. On the far side the path climbs up to rejoin the outward route.

    "summary": "The Fisherfield Forest - also known as the Great Wilderness - contains the remotest Munros in all Scotland. The effort required is fully repaid, however, as this is a spectacular region of dramatic peaks and ridges - the views from the summits are often claimed to be the finest in Scotland. The route is an epic round of all five Munros and one Corbett, starting and finishing at Shenavall bothy or a nearby wild camp.",
    "description": "The walk is described from Shenavall bothy; this can be reached via a walk-in from Corrie Hallie as described on the Shenavall route. The bothy is maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting. An alternative is to wild-camp; there is a great spot in the alder woods at NH088788; this is best reached by following the track used as the way back on the Shenavall circuit.\n\nFrom Shenavall Beinn a' Chlaidheimh rises extremely steeply across Strath na Sealga; although it is possible to make a direct assault many walkers will prefer to head up the strath and then approach it from the east, so start along the path which leads ESE. It becomes a track near the ruined house at Achneigie. Continue for another 1.5km - the alder woodland over to the right makes a great spot for a wild camp - until the track begins to climb to the left (bound for Corrie Hallie); instead follow a fainter, grassy track which heads west at this point and leads alongside the Abhainn Loch an Nid. This river must be waded - as with two river crossings at the end of the walk, this is not possible if the level is high.\n\nOn the far side, head directly up the slopes of Beinn Chlaidheimh. After wet but steep heather initially the slope eases to a more gradual grind until the much fiercer upper slopes are reached around 500m. Pass just left of the crags that guard the nose of the main ridge, making your way up steep heather as soon as practical to reach the ridge above at a flattish shoulder. There is then a brief climb up easy scree to gain the narrow summit ridge at point 900m. Follow this airy but grassy ridge across a slight dip to reach the summit cairn, with great views down the very steep west face into the strath, as well as back over the pinnacles of An Teallach. The descent begins almost immediately, with a path down the scree slope to a first bealach at 787m. Continue over a broad and bumpy section of ridge before a second descent leads down to a lower bealach at 650m, marked by a couple of lochans.\n\nContinue south up rough quartzite boulders to gain the very broad NE ridge of Sgùrr Ban. The ridge is littered with rough boulders all the way up the long pull to the top; there is grassier ground further right but this leads onto steeper terrain higher up. The summit cairn is in the centre of a small plateau but the walk continues in the same direction, heading down fairly straightforward slopes to reach the bealach at Cab Coire nan Clach. The next Munro, Mullach Coire Mhic Fhearchair, rises in intimidatingly steep slopes. However, there is an eroded path which leads up scree for the steepest part of the climb, and in good weather it can easily be picked out on the descent from Sgùrr Ban. The slope then eases and continues - still over stones and boulders - to the summit, the highest of the Fisherfield 6.\n\nThe descent is less steep, leading SW and then S, but even more covered with quartzite boulders which make it more time consuming. From the bealach beyond, the steep 851m peak of Meall Garbh appears to be a formidable obstacle, but a bypass path avoids this by cutting across its very steep NW slope to reach a second, lower bealach. From here the slopes of Beinn Tarsuinn are broad and mostly grassy, hiding the drama of the other side of this mountain, which is revealed only as the summit cairn is reached. Follow the narrow ridge to the left to soon reach a square tilted platform which sits astride the mountain and has been likened to a tennis court. A path scrambles easily up onto the 'Tennis Court' to reach a cairn at the far end before descending once more. The next section of ridge is riven into a series of pinnacles, but the walk continues by taking a clear bypass path which runs around the left side.\n\nContinue along the bypass path until a clear path forks off left very steeply down the loose slope. This leads to the extensive and very boggy bealach between Beinn Tarsuinn and A' Mhaighdean - the lowest point of the walk at 525m. The pull up to A' Mhaighdean from here is a very long grind up a broad, grassy slope - a real effort for tired legs. The lure is what is regarded as the remotest of all Munros - and perhaps the finest Munro summit view. The highest point is right on the edge of an abyss as the slopes to the west plunge for 800m down dramatic crags to the Dubh Loch, with Fionn Loch and the sea beyond and amazing rock architecture all around. The view south down to Gorm Loch Mòr and the crags of Beinn Lair is scarcely less impressive, and summiting A' Mhaighdean must be ranked amongst the highlights of a round by any Munroist.\n\nHead towards the more dome-like northern top before descending steep but largely grassy slopes and then rocky ground to reach the Poll Eadar dha Stac, the pass at the foot of Ruadh Stac Mòr . There is a very rough stone bivouac shelter here, which may be of use in an emergency. The last Munro of the round, Ruadh Stac Mòr , rises directly above and the route to it appears to be barred by a band of crags, whilst a stalkers path cuts off to the left to descend past Fuar Loch Mòr . A small cairn, however, marks the point to strike up the well-worn scree slope to reach the foot of the cliffs. The route through the crags above can be picked out during the descent from A' Mhaighdean; it heads up an eroded gully above the scree slope. Getting into the gully requires a straightforward scramble, best started slightly along a ledge to the right from the top of the scree path. From here a big scrambling step up leads onto a wide, well-worn stony gangway that slopes to the left and then continues up the gully before emerging on the boulderfields of the upper slopes.\n\nA faint path winds up the boulders and passes through a gap in the summit crags to reach the cairn. This is another superlative viewpoint in the very heart of the wilderness, surrounded by dramatic rock peaks and glistening lochans; to the north are the Lochan a'Bhragdad backed by the perfect cone of Beinn Dearg Bheag and the pinnacled ridges of Beinn Dearg Mòr beyond. Head along the NNW ridge - negotiating yet more boulderfields - for around 250m before aiming directly between the two lochans to the NE. The slope is terraced with several steeper sections unseen from above. Pass between the lochans and continue north, following a burn down into the hanging valley below. Cross the burn and aim diagonally up the slope opposite to pick up an excellent stalkers path above the Clach na Frithealaidh - a prominent rock.\n\nFollow the path to the right. It angles down towards Loch Beinn Dearg before swinging back to lead easily down Gleann na Muice Beag, eventually leading down to a path running along the Abhainn Ghleann na Muice, a substantial river. Continue down this path to reach the chalet and cottage amidst the group of trees at Larachantivore. Wade the river near here - again, this is impossible in spate. The direct route back to Shenavall now crosses a severe bog, with great care needed to avoid stepping into one of many waist-deep, slime-filled pools, before reaching the second river, the Abhainn Strath na Sealga, just short of the bothy. Alternatively you could continue by the riverbank to the junction of the two rivers. Either way, the second river too needs to be waded before heading back to Shenavall.",

    "description": "Begin at the parking area on the left just before Balsporran Cottages off the west side of the A9. The cottages are situated in an extremely bleak spot at 425 metres - in winter this is as cold as spot as you will find in Britain. Pass the cottages and cross the level crossing over the railway beyond, continuing along the track. Note the state of the burn on the left at this point, as the route crosses this right at the end. Ignore the first main track forking right, instead continuing to reach a tributary burn, crossing this via a bridge.\n\nSoon after this look out for another track forking to the right. Take this; it becomes better made for a time before eventually being succeeded by a path. Continue up the heathery slopes with improving views back over Drumochter.\n\nContinue to the flat shoulder where a set of once mighty cairns stood. Only one of the original cairns remains, though a set of more makeshift neighbours has appeared including a shelter cairn. The path peters out for a time on the flat shoulder beyond.\n\nThe summit of Geal Chàrn is an easy kilometre beyond. Although an undistinguished Munro and one of the easiest to reach, the cairn at the summit has a grand view over Loch Ericht to Ben Alder. To the south can be seen the more shapely hill of A' Mharconaich.\n\nDescend southwest and then south to reach the wide bealach at 739 metres, with superb views along the length of Loch Ericht throughout the descent.\n\nThere's a track across the bealach which is followed for around 350m to the right, before tackling the clear path off left to head up the broad slopes beyond. When the ground levels out turn left along the broad, plateau-like ridge; there continue to be stunning views behind to Ben Alder.\n\nContinue northeast across the plateau to reach the summit cairn; the area on the final approach is covered by areas of matting intended to help secure vegetation - it looks very odd in aerial photographs. The first part of the descent from the summit is the steepest part of the day; descend northwards down a spur, with a steep corrie on the right; this requires care under the winter conditions when these hills are popular.\n\nThe spur flattens out before steepening again as it curves round to the northeast. Continue down the now gentler ridge. Lower down the path becomes very boggy. You can either continue along it and cross the burn to rejoin the route by the private crossing, or if you think the burn is high then it may be better to bear left earlier to join the track from the bealach.

    "summary": "Am Basteir ('The Executioner') is a spectacular peak at the back of Coire Basteir, in the centre of the famous view from Sligachan, accompanied by the jagged Basteir Tooth. The ascent of the ridge is an airy scramble with a notorious 'bad step' - but the whole walk is through stunning surroundings.",
    "description": "Take the Dunvegan road from Sligachan and park in the lay-by immediately on the right, taking care not to block the entrance to the Mountain Rescue post. The footpath begins on the opposite side of the road at the far end of the lay-by It soon leads to a footbridge high over the river; cross this and continue on the now excellent footpath uphill. After a couple of kilometres it comes alongside another attractive cascading stream (the Allt Dearg Beag) and gives improving views.\n\nTo the left of the great peaks there are views out across Glen Sligachan to the Red Cuillin and Marsco. Do not cross the next footbridge (which is the path to Sgùrr nan Gillean) but instead continue on the right side of the stream. Eventually the path swings round to the left and there is a magnificent view of the entrance to the Basteir Gorge, with the great Pinnacle Ridge of Sgùrr nan Gillean towering above.\n\nThe route ascends the steep slopes to the right of the gorge. The going is easiest at first along the left edge of the scree slope. Higher up the route zig-zags up the rocky slopes, following little ramps to the left and right, with short, easy sections of scrambling. The route can be quite hard to follow as the path is not visible on the rocky sections.\n\nThe ground levels out and the route continues traversing the rocky ground before eventually reaching the river again. Continue up over the lip into the grassy bowl of Coire Basteir. This is a spectacular and forbidding spot, with the great rock walls of Sgùrr nan Gillean to the left and Am Basteir and its famous tooth ahead; the scene is softened only by the reedy lochan at the bottom of the coire.\n\nThe direct route out of the back of the coire is barred by crags; the correct way is on a clear scree path with starts over the left side of the coire, near the foot of the great gully coming down from between the two highest peaks of Sgùrr nan Gillean. Once found, the path heads clearly across and up the scree to reach the foot of the cliffs of Am Basteir at their lowest point. From here, continue up the steepening scree slopes to the left. It is best to keep right of an outcrop higher up, before slanting left to reach the pass between Sgùrr nan Gillean and Am Basteir - the Bealach Basteir (photo shows the approach to Sgùrr nan Gillean - a rock climbing route from the bealach).\n\nThe direct ascent of the ridge is a somewhat airy scramble with one very significant difficulty - a vertical drop known as the Bad Step whose descent is graded as a Severe rock-climb (requiring climbing skills and equipment). This can be avoided on ledges on the south side - but this requires difficult route finding over loose, dangerous terrain - you need to leave the ridge before reaching the step. One option is to leave the ridge a short distance above the bealach - just before it steepens. Traverse across to an orangey slab seen ahead. Ascend this slab (slippery when wet and with some exposure, keep off any small stones on the slab) and then continue traversing leftwards until, after crossing a wall, head right up ramp of purplish rock. This returns you to the ridge just beyond the Bad Step. From this point the ridge leads more easily to the summit. This is a spectacular place.\n\nLooking back, Sgùrr nan Gillean looks impressive. Return to Bealach a' Basteir - either by ascending the Bad Step or using the bypass (which is slightly easier to find in this direction) and then continue back down the scree to below the lowest point in the cliffs, reached earlier.\n\nThe quickest return to Sligachan is by the route of ascent, but it is more interesting and easier (though longer) to make a different return. From the lowest point in the cliffs, continue to keep the cliffs on your left by ascending the scree ahead (there is a path). This leads up below the spectacular Basteir Tooth to reach the Bealach na Lice. From the Bealach na Lice, it is worth detouring to the right along the narrow rock ridge to the summit of Sgùrr a Basteir, which has fantastic views of Am Basteir and Sgùrr nan Gillean.\n\nOn returning to the Bealach na Lice, you can extend the walk by taking in Bruach na Frithe or you can descend down the path into Fionn Coire. Follow the clear path down until it disappears on a lower, grassy level of the coire. At this point head left following occasional cairns until the path is picked up again by a large cairn where it crosses a stream. Follow the path down until it reaches the main path up to the Am Mam pass. Follow this path down the left bank of the stream to Sligachan.",

    "description": "Park at the car park at the very end of the road up Glen Nevis. There is a tremendous water slide descending from Ben Nevis here. Follow the main path up the glen into predominantly deciduous woodland. The path is very popular but the surface is rocky in places. After a few hundred metres the glen curves to the right and narrows, with the cliffs across the river giving some of the feel of an Alpine gorge. The path continues up the glen and soon emerges from the trees. The section of the more open glen ahead makes a tremendous view, with the green pastures of the valley floor surrounded by fine woodland backed by great mountains - with as centrepiece the great Steall Falls, a tremendous waterfall where a stream cascades four hundred feet down a broken cliff into the glen.\n\nBear right off the main path onto a smaller one heading for the steel-cable bridge. This consists of three cables - two for handrails, and one on which you can balance your boots. The brave will edge across it, high over the river, whilst the more circumspect will paddle across the shallows just upstream (impossible in spate conditions). Once across, turn left and pass the Steall Hut (private) and continue into the woods to cross the burn on the rocks at the very base of the Steall falls. If in spate, this may be easier on the flats just downstream.\n\nContinue around the base of the next buttress on extremely boggy ground. Once beyond this take the stalkers' path heading uphill. It soon reaches a section where a landslip has destroyed the old path - continue up steeply beside this. There are great views back over the Steall Meadows. Further up the path improves, eventually traversing right across the corrie, whereupon it continues uphill in a series of zigzags until heading to the right onto the shoulder of a grassy ridge.\n\nFollow the path that climbs steeply southeast up this ridge. Above the steep section the ascent finally relents a little along a straightforward grassy section before the final pull up to the summit of An Gearanach. This is the first Munro of the day, at 982 metres, and has tremendous views both back to Ben Nevis and across to Sgùrr a' Mhaim.\n\nFrom here, continue along the ridge which narrows to the dramatic, rocky arête of An Garbhanach. The traverse of this 'Top' is an airy but fairly straightforward but exposed scramble, reminiscent but a little harder than the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arete. The scrambling continues as the ridge heads down to the next bealach. Continue by climbing up to Stob Coire a' Chàirn; the scrambling is over for now but the ridge steepens with some scree towards the top. The cairn is at 981 metres and is the second Munro of the day; there are great views, particularly of the Grey Corries and eastern Mamores. Descend the much easier, grassy southwest ridge, traversing over a minor summit, before beginning the steep climb up to Am Bodach. This is rocky and a little loose, so care is needed with the mild scrambling on the ascent. Am Bodach (The Old Man) is 1032m high - the third Munro of the day.\n\nDescend the easier west ridge which drops down to another bealach before a straightforward climb up to Sgùrr an Iubhair. At 1001 metres, this was briefly a Munro between 1981 and 1997, a promotion and relegation in status that only the Scottish Mountaineering Club could explain! The route now turns north away from the main spine of the Mamores, following instead what has been named 'The Devil's Ridge'. It begins easily enough as it descends NNW to a wide bealach, before beginning the traverse of the 'Top' of Stob Coire a' Mhail. This is an excitingly exposed and narrow arete, mainly grassy with a path along the crest.\n\nOn the descent from the Top, there is one trickier section of ridge composed of shattered rocks. It can be scrambled over, but most walkers avoid it by taking a bypass path which descends a little on the left, climbing back to the ridge just beyond. A short distance further the descent of a rock step is the final minor obstacle - this is most easily climbed down by starting on the right and descending it diagonally towards the left. Beyond, the ridge continues easily to Sgùrr a' Mhaim, the latter section being on the quartzite stones that give this mountain the appearance of being snow covered. There are great views back along the Devil's Ridge.\n\nSgùrr a' Mhaim is the fourth and final Munro of the day, and its position away from the main ridge makes it a magnificent viewpoint; Stob Ban looks especially fine to the southwest. Do not be tempted to descend the northeast ridge towards Steall, as there is difficult and dangerous steep ground much lower down which has been the scene of fatal accidents. Instead, take the easier northwest ridge, down shattered quartzite at first.\n\nThe ridge becomes grassier lower down but the descent is pretty unrelentingly steep. It eventually leads to path above the Allt Coire a' Mhusgain. Follow this path down to reach the road just east of the Lower Falls car park. Turn right at the road but then immediately right again befeore the bridge to take the path on the near side of the river until Paddy's Bridge at NN158684 before using that to return to the tarmac.

Cross the road and the stile over the fence opposite to pick up and follow a very boggy path across the moorland, keeping just to the left side of the flattest part of the glen.\n\nThe Abhainn a'Ghrabainn is a substantial watercourse and can be a formidable obstacle - when in spate conditions it is quite impassable. Even with better weather you'll most likely have to wade across the cold waters. Once on the far side follow a faint path that skirts along the base of several moraines.\n\nThe path becomes clearer as it leads up to the east of the Allt na h-Uidhe; after a boggy start it even becomes drier for a time, passing a fine small waterfall. After reaching the upper level of the corrie the ground becomes wet once more. The path eventually diverges from the burn and ascends more steeply, aiming for the bealach north of Sàil Liath.\n\nOnce at this bealach, head north along the gentle ridge, covered with coarse grasses and a few stones in places. The next section of the walk can be very pleasant in decent weather conditions; the track marked on OS maps proves to be just faint ATV tracks in the grass. Head up and over point 844m, revealing ever more stunning views across to Beinn Dearg and Cona' Mheall; the Fannichs and Fisherfields are also well seen whilst looking back south along the ridge Ben Wyvis closes the distant horizon.\n\nAfter the broad dome at 844 metres there is a very slight descent. From this dip the route climbs again, to reach a shoulder where another ridge joins in, coming up from Meall Gorm. There is now just a short 50 metre ascent to the summit of the mountain. Am Faochagach has two cairns close together, with the higher one at 953 metres. The distant panoramas are very extensive although the flat summit robs them of much depth; Suilven is well seen as is Seana Bhràigh with its dramatic top Creag an Duine.\n\nDominating the view is Beinn Dearg - which is seen to greater effect by heading a short distance to the west to reveal the drama of Coire Ghrunnda. An Teallach is well seen over its shoulder.\n\nUnless intent on a mammoth cross-country trek, the usual route of return is to reverse the way used on the ascent.",

Follow the track as it crosses the River Falloch on a bridge and continue on the track heading gently uphill, passing through a gate. Ahead you can see the grassy flank of Sròn Gharbh. This is the first objective on the way to the summit of An Caisteal. The path up the ridge is now blocked by wire mesh blocking what was a gate, so instead follow the track for a kilometre to reach and pass through a gate, then turn right alongside the fence (no path) for 200m to join the path after the blocked gateway. Now turn left along the rough path; this first section of ascent is easy going with a couple of very short rocky steep sections and great views back.\n\nFurther up there is a faint path with becomes clearer as the first top of Sròn Gharbh is reached. From here there is a fairly clear path to Sròn Gharbh and beyond up the ridge well-named Twistin Hill. The path follows the meandering ridge as it climbs steadily with lumpy rocky sections every now and again. About two thirds of the way along there is a deep cleft, easily crossed on a path requiring a couple of steep steps. The path then heads around a rocky knoll before climbing to the summit of An Caisteal (995m).\n\nFrom the summit continue south on a small path that follows the clear ridge. At a couple of places there are rocky steps that are easily negotiated. The Bealach Buidhe is soon reached. From here the path traverses diagonally south east to head slightly right from the bealach up a rocky slope. The path winds up the steep buttress of Beinn a'Chròin, with one short section of scrambling (avoidable by an awkward detour to the right) to reach the plateau.\n\nFrom here the path is straightforward as it winds between rocky lumps and tiny lochans - a small cairn marks the true highest point of the mountain. After a final steep dip there is a short steep section before the small cairn on the eastern summit is reached. Just before the top, a fainter path joins from the left - this is the return route.\n\nFrom the eastern summit there are wide ranging views over the Trossachs and further east and north. Leave by heading north back down the path you came on for a short distance and then continuing straight ahead down the grassy ridge. There is a faint path for most of the descent, which is a little eroded on some of the steeper sections. Aim for the point where the two streams meet and cross them just before the confluence.\n\nFrom here there is a path following the west side of the River Falloch. The River has some lovely clear pools which can be inviting on a hot day. The route reaches a hydro works and then joins a hydro track that leads back to rejoin the outward route.

    "description": "Park in the small parking area just north of Torrandhu bridge on the A835. There is a Met Office weather station here. Rather than head up beside the boggy burn, a signpost instead points to a start which leads briefly east along the road. Cross the bridge and then take a right turn onto a track into the forestry. After 2.5km turn right downhill, emerging from the trees and crossing a bridge over Abhainn an Torrain Dubh. On the far side the track continues as a rough ATV track, which is boggy and intermittent in places. It does, however, assist with the ascent up towards Creag Dubh Fannaich.\n\nWhen the ATV track swings left at around 560m leave it and continue on a faint path. This peters out; continue to reach the minor summit of Creag Dhubh Fannaich, marked by a small cairn; the view extends back over Loch Glascarnoch, whilst the final two Munros on today's route look impressive above lochan-filled corries. Continue across a broad bealach and begin the ascent of Beinn Liath Mhòr Fannaich itself up a mixture of grass and boulders. The cairn on the summit, the first Munro of the day at 953 metres, is towards the western end of the small plateau, by some rocky outcrops. A good view opens out westwards over Loch a'Mhadaidh, with the prominent dome-like summit of Sgùrr Mòr towering to its left.\n\nThe intervening bealach can very difficult to locate in misty conditions, with intervening steep, stony and very loose terrain. It's probably best to descend just slightly north of west from the summit for a short distance, soon over steep stony and loose ground, to meet a stalkers path that cuts across the west side of the mountain. Turn left along this, which cuts through the steep ground and zig-zags down to the bealach. The stalkers path continues up the far side of the bealach and passes to the left of a minor peak before the ridge narrows briefly. As the ridge broadens again, the stalkers path contours round to the left; leave the path here and climb more directly up the steep slopes towards Sgùrr Mòr - again with big drops on the right.\n\nThe slope eases shortly before the impressively built summit cairn on the summit of Sgùrr Mòr is reached. At 1110 metres, this second Munro is the highest summit for miles around, and its impressive 'witches hat' outline marking it out in distant views from other mountains across the region. The view, as might be expected, is very extensive, with Sgùrr nan Clach Geala looking very impressive close at hand, and An Teallach commanding to the northwest.\n\nDescend back down the south ridge, briefly retracing steps before continuing down a slope eroded into a series of terraces made by a process known as solufluction during the last ice-age. From the bealach continue up over the minor summit of Meall nan Peithirean with its flat rocks. There are excellent views to the north all along this ridge down into a series of rocky, lochan-filled corries. The path descends gently down the far side of this top to reach a bealach, and after passing to the right of the bump of Creachan Rairigidh reaches a second bealach. Here the path forks, with a branch to the south descending towards Loch Fannich; our route follows the path which climbs up to the summit of Meall Gorm. This flat-topped Munro is the third of the walk, and has a height of 949 metres.\n\nThe ridge continues east, passing a curious and partly collapsed stone shelter presumably built by stalkers. Continue to a final top at 922m before descending steeper stony ground to reach the wide Bealach Ban. From the bealach, continue up the very wide grass and scree-covered slopes to the summit plateau - it is possible to avoid the scree by taking a traverse to the right part way up the slope - once beyond the scree ascent grassy slopes direct to the summit.\n\nThe summit of the fourth Munro, An Coileachan, is marked by a well-built cairn atop a sandstone outcrop. There's a great view looking along to the termination of the ridge at An Eigin, backed by Loch Luichart, as well as looking back over the whole range and Loch Fannich.\n\nHead north across the plateau before picking your way steeply down a stonier section - any difficulties can be avoided to the left side - heading in the direction of Loch Gorm. Once on flatter ground follow a more defined path to the bealach southwest of Meallan Buidhe. The route on from here becomes very boggy and very rough, though with a path of sorts at first. Contour the west side of Meallan Buidhe and aim a little east of north across the moors - the path fades out - to reach the Abhainn a'Ghuibhais Li at a bridge. Cross and then follow the far bank of the burn downstream to the second bridge used on the ascent. Cross this to retrace your steps via the forest track - with some unwelcome ascent - back to the car park.",

The monument on the left commemorates the 'Chisholm stone' - the traditional gathering place of the glen - now submerged beneath the waters of the loch. The track has been improved for a hydro scheme - follow it on an undulating course to reach a hydro powerhouse and then cross the dilapidated bridge over the Allt Mullardoch beyond. On the far side leave the track to head directly northwest towards Mullach na Maoile.\n\nThe climb soon becomes steep up a slope of heather and bracken; the easiest line is between two tiny streambeds. From the flat top of the Mullach na Maoile, there is a slight dip before the final long stony rise to Càrn nan Gobhar, the first Munro of the day. There are two summits, the first with a very well-built cairn, whilst the second is the true summit, across a slight depression. The best views are to the west, looking across to the lochans, corries and ridges of Sgùrr na Lapaich.\n\nDescend the stone ridge to the Bealach na Cloiche Duibhe (Pass of the Black Rock). Sgùrr na Lapaich can look intimidating from here; the route of ascent is up the facing ridge, grassy lower down but rocky high up. Follow the narrow path up it; this keeps just to the left of the true ridge line, at one point following a strange lateral grassy ridge caused by a landslip; the ascent does cross a few short sections of boulders but avoids any scrambling. The ridge ends right by the summit, marked by a large wind-shelter cairn containing a trig point. The view is both extensive and dramatic, particularly back across the cliffs to Loch Tuill Bhearnach, whilst the next objective, the great ridged mountain of An Riabhachan, looks impressive to the west. Descend the fairly grassy ridge southwest to the Bealach Toll an Lochain.\n\nThe bealach is a low one at 820 metres so the re-ascent to An Riabhachan is considerable. A path leads up the first broad slope. This leads up to a fine, narrow grassy ridge that makes for a delightful ascent. The views back of the steep, broken slopes of Sgùrr na Lapaich towering over Loch Mòr are very impressive, whilst the ridge itself maintains interest in the route ahead. The climb ends when the ridge levels out at 1120 metres. It now widens but is grassy and the almost level walk along to the summit cairn of An Riabhachan is easy and enjoyable if the weather is good.\n\nThe well-built summit cairn has very steep slopes dropping down to the left and a glimpse of Loch Mullardoch, with the Càrn Eige range beyond it, but it is to the north that the view excels. Most of Loch Monar can be seen (rather spoiled by the water extraction tide-mark around it) whilst beyond and to the northwest rise a fantastic array of peaks stretching away into Torridon. Continue along the almost level ridge to the cairned summit at 1080 metres where the main ridge turns sharply left. Follow the path that continues west, soon descending very steeply to a lower section of ridge. The next section of this ridge is very narrow but easy enough; it then climbs slightly to a minor summit (which can be avoided on the left).\n\nThe ridge now descends southwest, the path on the crest avoiding the slabby blocks off to the right. There is then a second steep section of descent (easy scrambling) to reach the Bealach a'Bholla. An Socach looks impressive from here, the east top appearing as a steep pyramid crowning the ridge ahead (and giving the mountain its name). Follow the path directly up the ridge; there is one rocky step on the path but this can be easily avoided to the right. From the east top the ridge leads easily on to the main summit with a tumbledown windshelter cairn housing a trig point. An Socach is one of the remotest Munros in Scotland and its central position in the Northwest Highlands makes it a fabulous viewpoint. The coast and Skye look close in good visibility, whilst Torridon and the Monar peaks look fabulous. Nearer at hand there are good views across the dramatic eastern corrie towards Loch Mullardoch.\n\nFor the descent, follow the ridge along the edge of the corrie. After a couple of kilometres the descent steepens before reaching the start of the flat ridge stretching east to Meall Bac a' Chul-dhoire. This final section of ridge is riven by eroded peat hags and rather than continue across them at, it is probably best to bear left across the bogs to reach the nearby Allt Coire a' Mhaim. Cross this to pick up faint path down the far side. The path soon improves (though boggy in places) and leads down past several attractive waterfalls to approach close to the shores of Loch Mullardoch. Cross the Allt Socrach bridge on the left before following an initially faint path right almost to the tide-mark.\n\nYou are now faced with a very long and tiring walk back to the start. The path improves as it traverses across the very steep grassy slopes which plunge down to the loch. At several points care is needed as the drop onto the stony tide-mark is steep and the path is eroded in parts. After almost four kilometres of this undulating path the slope eases; the path now fades out. A kilometre further the foot of the Allt Taige is reached. There is no bridge over this stream and it could be a dangerous trap if the water is high (if in doubt, you should reverse the route so as to cross the Taige early in the day). The easiest place to cross is usually just above the outflow into the loch. On the far side, continue above the loch to reach a pinewood; pass just above this and continue traversing to reach the bridge over the Allt Mullardoch crossed earlier in the day. Now you simply have to follow the undulating, muddy track back to the start.",

    "description": "Park at the Linn of Dee car park; there is a charge payable to the National Trust for Scotland. Begin the walk by returning to the Linn of Dee road and turning right towards the bridge. As the road bends left to cross the Dee, continue straight ahead onto the track past the barrier - it is signed as a right of way to places such as Blair Atholl (via Glen Tilt) and Kingussie (via Glen Feshie) - both superb long-distance cross-country walks. The track leads past some fine old granny pines, with the beautiful River Dee on the left. Further on the remains of several old townships can be seen dotted around the glen floor.\n\nAfter just short of 5km a path goes off to the right - destined for Corrour Bothy and a back route through to the Lairig Ghru. Our route continues along the track, crossing White Bridge over the Dee. Further on some plantations on the right - felled in part - do detract from the feeling of wildness, and Glen Geldie lacks some of the attractiveness of Glen Tilt or Glen Feshie to which it can lead. However there is no denying this is truly remote country. When the track forks, take the right branch to keep on the north side of the Geldie towards a building - the more open glen across the Geldie is that of the Bynack Burn (and is the through route to Glen Tilt).\n\nThe building is Ruighe Ealasaid (the Red House) - derelict for many years but since 2022 renovated and open as an MBA bothy for walkers to stay in. Continue up the increasingly bleak Glen Geldie. After passing a plantation the track reaches a ford over the Allt Dhaidh Beag, but there is a footbridge just to the right. Further on the Allt Dhaidh Mòr has no bridge and usually has a substantial volume of water - it may require a wade (or be impossible in high spate). After a further kilometre ignore a track off to the right (the onward route to Glen Feshie) and instead continue down to reach the ford over the River Geldie itself. This usually will involve getting wet feet - and again could be impassable in spate).\n\nAfter crossing another tributary the track leads to its destination - the ruins of Geldie Lodge. Only a small, doorless shed can provide any shelter here. From here follow the very well-maintained stalkers path that continues west - it winds about initially but provides much easier walking than the rough moors around. The path extends further than is shown on many OS maps; follow it as it eventually descends slightly to reach the Allt a'Chaorainn. Cross this burn and head west up onto the moorland. There is a faint path initially but this is soon lost as the route continues across boggy ground before climbing up onto the north ridge of Càrn an Fhidhleir - thankfully now on firmer, stony ground. Head up the ridge to reach the summit cairn - a real prize for any Munro-bagger. Whilst the summit area is quite flat, the views are very extensive.\n\nA surprisingly clear path heads SEE along the ridge. It traverses the left flank on the minor bump of point 906m, though this crosses steep grass and it may be easier to continue over the top before heading steeply down to the bealach to the east, a peat mess at 702m. Continue up the far side, through heather at first before more open ground is reached once more. The large summit cairn of An Sgarsoch is a short distance beyond a rocky outcrop, and has good views of the main Cairngorms range.\n\nDescend northwards. There is a short steeper section part way down, but otherwise wide open slopes lead towards the bealach with Sgarsoch Bheag. A path avoids this hillock on the west side, eventually swinging round to the right before petering out. Continue northwards to rejoin the excellent stalkers path used on the approach, and turn right to begin the long walk back to the Linn of Dee.\n\nThe return retraces the outward route. The river crossings seem even more tiring on the long march back, passing the old cottage near the Geldie/Bynack junction and then White Bridge before the final section above the Dee.",

    "description": "The start of this walk is from Alltbeithe (also known as Glen Affric YHA), the remotest hostel in Britain. Allbeithe can only be reached on foot, and an overnight stop in the hostel, camping or at Camban bothy prior to this walk will be essential for most. The shortest approach is via the An Caorannmor from the Cluanie Inn. Far better approaches are by walking in from Glen Affric, or either of the two halves described in this circular route from Morvich, Kintail. To begin the walk from the hostel, take the path which leads out the back passing the separate dormitory building and the water supply.\n\nThe route bends to the right and crosses the Allt Beithe Min, and then the Allt na Faing. Just beyond this latter stream, the excellently constructed path passes through a gate in the deer fence and begins to climb, keeping to the east side of the stream. A good view back of the Alltbeithe hostel opens up as height is gained; further up the mountainside, a second deer fence is reached at another gate. Continue up the path; further on the surface deteriorates and the going becomes boggier as Coire na Cloiche is reached. Continue on the soggy path which climbs more gently up to the bealach (pass) at about 790 metres, with a view down the far side into desolate Gleann a'Choilich.\n\nFrom here, you need the decide which of the three peaks to tackle first. It seems a good idea to make it Mullach na Dheiragain, the remotest peak - Sgùrr na Ceathreamhnan can be bypassed on the route out and climbed on the way back. To do this, do not descend north from the bealach but head west along the ridge for about two hundred metres first. At this point what looks at first like a small stream bed leads northwest off the ridge, leading to traces of a path descending fairly steeply northwest. Once down to the 750 metre contour, turn west heading for the outflow at the bottom of the Loch Coire nan Dearcag lochans. These lochans are set in a grand, remote corrie, backed by crags. Crossing the boggy area below them is relatively straightforward; now head northwest up straightforward slopes to reach the Bealach nan Daoine.\n\nAt the pass you will meet a path along the ridge; turn right along it. It climbs up towards the Top of Càrn na Con Dhu. The summit area of this peak can be confusing in mist are there are various knobbly undulations. Towards the northeast end, a short boulder field is crossed and after that the ridge narrows, with steep slopes on the right, and the way is clearer, descending in two sections to reach the Bealach na Con Dhu. Continue along the ridge, heading up the wide and sprawling slopes of Mullach na Dheiragain. The path seems to wander off left rather than ascending, so strike out directly up the slope to locate the summit cairn towards the far end. Mullach na Dheiragain is a Munro at 982 metres, and is one of the least accessible of all Britain's peaks. Reaching it from and returning to any roadside starting point inside a day is a feat for supermen only, so its summit is a real prize, even if the summit area lacks distinction.\n\nReturn back down the ridge, crossing the Bealach na Con Dhu and Càrn na Con Dhu, to return to the Bealach nan Daoine. This time, continue along the ridge as it ascends once more. As height is gained the ridge narrows and steepens to give a fine route directly to the summit cairn of Sgùrr nan Ceathreamhnan. This is the highest Munro in the immediate area, at 1151 metres, and is at the apex of several ridges as well as being a very extensive viewpoint.\n\nThe summit ridge leading west from the cairn is narrow and dramatic, but the continuation of our walk is to descend the southeast ridge. This descends continuously at first before turning east and crossing several undulations and minor summits before reaching the bealach reached earlier, at the top of the path up from Alltbeithe.\n\nBefore descending back to Alltbeithe, it is straightforward to include the third Munro of An Socach in the itinerary. Continue east from the bealach, climbing briefly before crossing a flat area with several lochans. The dome of An Socach looms just beyond, and is easily ascended following the path.\n\nThe summit cairn is 921 metres, making it the smallest of the three summits. Return to the bealach, and then retrace the path back down to Alltbeithe via the Allt na Faing.",

The walk begins through the large gate on a landrover track; keep left at the fork and follow the track past an old farmhouse into the Baddoch Glen.\n\nBeyond the farmhouse the track soon crosses a bridge over the Baddoch burn and continues up the other side. After another kilometre the track fords the Allt Coire Fhearneasg. Once across it, leave the track here, turning right onto a narrow path which initially follows the stream uphill. At a fork, keep left. When the slope eases the left path (if you picked it up) bears left away from the stream, aiming for a cairn on Socach Mòr ; the ascent to here is very gradual.\n\nThere is brief flatter, boggier section before the path - now clear once more - tackles the steeper slope ahead up the east ridge of the east Top of An Socach, making use of a zig-zag. Above this steeper section the gradients become very gentle.\n\nContinue along the broad, stony ridge to the east Top of An Socach - or bypass most of the stones by following a faint path just to the south side. The ridge continues beyond, descending very slightly to a minor bealach.\n\nThe broad ridge - almost a plateau - continues west, with broad paths in places but seemingly none in others. After more minor bumps there is a final short climb to reach the windshelter cairn at the true western summit (there is another lower cairn nearby). The summit has a view of the main mass of the Cairngorms to the northwest, as well as Glas Tulaichean closer at hand.\n\nThe easiest return route is to retrace your steps.",

    "description": "Take the minor road leading to the north end of the Loch Mullardoch dam. There is only very limited parking just beyond the dam; there is more space part way up the dam road on the right. Go through the gate at the end of the road and follow the track beyond, keeping above the ugly tide mark of the reservoir. The monument on the left commemorates the 'Chisholm stone' - the traditional gathering place of the glen - now submerged beneath the waters of the loch. The track has been improved for a hydro scheme - follow it on an undulating course to reach a hydro powerhouse and then cross the dilapidated bridge over the Allt Mullardoch beyond. On the far side leave the track to head directly northwest towards Mullach na Maoile.\n\nThe climb soon becomes steep up a slope of heather and bracken; the easiest line is between two tiny streambeds. From the flat top of the Mullach na Maoile, there is a slight dip before the final long stony rise to Càrn nan Gobhar, the first Munro of the day. There are two summits, the first with a very well-built cairn, whilst the second is the true summit, across a slight depression. The best views are to the west, looking across to the lochans, corries and ridges of Sgùrr na Lapaich.\n\nDescend the stone ridge to the Bealach na Cloiche Duibhe (Pass of the Black Rock). Sgùrr na Lapaich can look intimidating from here; the route of ascent is up the facing ridge, grassy lower down but rocky high up. Follow the narrow path up it; this keeps just to the left of the true ridge line, at one point following a strange lateral grassy ridge caused by a landslip; the ascent does cross a few short sections of boulders but avoids any scrambling. The ridge ends right by the summit, marked by a large wind-shelter cairn containing a trig point. The view is both extensive and dramatic, particularly back across the cliffs to Loch Tuill Bhearnach, whilst the next objective, the great ridged mountain of An Riabhachan, looks impressive to the west. Descend the fairly grassy ridge southwest to the Bealach Toll an Lochain.\n\nThe bealach is a low one at 820 metres so the re-ascent to An Riabhachan is considerable. A path leads up the first broad slope. This leads up to a fine, narrow grassy ridge that makes for a delightful ascent. The views back of the steep, broken slopes of Sgùrr na Lapaich towering over Loch Mòr are very impressive, whilst the ridge itself maintains interest in the route ahead. The climb ends when the ridge levels out at 1120 metres. It now widens but is grassy and the almost level walk along to the summit cairn of An Riabhachan is easy and enjoyable if the weather is good.\n\nThe well-built summit cairn has very steep slopes dropping down to the left and a glimpse of Loch Mullardoch, with the Càrn Eige range beyond it, but it is to the north that the view excels. Most of Loch Monar can be seen (rather spoiled by the water extraction tide-mark around it) whilst beyond and to the northwest rise a fantastic array of peaks stretching away into Torridon. Continue along the almost level ridge to the cairned summit at 1080 metres where the main ridge turns sharply left. Follow the path that continues west, soon descending very steeply to a lower section of ridge. The next section of this ridge is very narrow but easy enough; it then climbs slightly to a minor summit (which can be avoided on the left).\n\nThe ridge now descends southwest, the path on the crest avoiding the slabby blocks off to the right. There is then a second steep section of descent (easy scrambling) to reach the Bealach a'Bholla. An Socach looks impressive from here, the east top appearing as a steep pyramid crowning the ridge ahead (and giving the mountain its name). Follow the path directly up the ridge; there is one rocky step on the path but this can be easily avoided to the right. From the east top the ridge leads easily on to the main summit with a tumbledown windshelter cairn housing a trig point. An Socach is one of the remotest Munros in Scotland and its central position in the Northwest Highlands makes it a fabulous viewpoint. The coast and Skye look close in good visibility, whilst Torridon and the Monar peaks look fabulous. Nearer at hand there are good views across the dramatic eastern corrie towards Loch Mullardoch.\n\nFor the descent, follow the ridge along the edge of the corrie. After a couple of kilometres the descent steepens before reaching the start of the flat ridge stretching east to Meall Bac a' Chul-dhoire. This final section of ridge is riven by eroded peat hags and rather than continue across them at, it is probably best to bear left across the bogs to reach the nearby Allt Coire a' Mhaim. Cross this to pick up faint path down the far side. The path soon improves (though boggy in places) and leads down past several attractive waterfalls to approach close to the shores of Loch Mullardoch. Cross the Allt Socrach bridge on the left before following an initially faint path right almost to the tide-mark.\n\nYou are now faced with a very long and tiring walk back to the start. The path improves as it traverses across the very steep grassy slopes which plunge down to the loch. At several points care is needed as the drop onto the stony tide-mark is steep and the path is eroded in parts. After almost four kilometres of this undulating path the slope eases; the path now fades out. A kilometre further the foot of the Allt Taige is reached. There is no bridge over this stream and it could be a dangerous trap if the water is high (if in doubt, you should reverse the route so as to cross the Taige early in the day). The easiest place to cross is usually just above the outflow into the loch. On the far side, continue above the loch to reach a pinewood; pass just above this and continue traversing to reach the bridge over the Allt Mullardoch crossed earlier in the day. Now you simply have to follow the undulating, muddy track back to the start.",

The walk can easily be extended to take in the higher summit.",
    "description": "There is no parking at the start of the walk; the only option is to park either at the Lawers Hotel or the farmer's yard which sometimes offers parking in the busy season, both of which offer parking for a charge. Begin the walk by heading east (carefully!) along the main road. After half a kilometre along there is a white-painted cottage on the left selling antler and bone-carved products. Turn left up the track immediately beyond this. When the track swings right at a barn go straight ahead on a signed path through the trees. This soon leads up to a track, which once again swings right - again take the path straight ahead.\n\nThe path climbing up through the birchwoods is a delight, crossing a couple of small bridges and later a stile. After a second stile the trees are left behind and the Ben Lawers National Nature reserve is entered by a sign. Beyond it the path passes through an area dotted with old shielings, where folk once would have lived during the summer months. Further on the path descends into the deep gully of the Lawers burn; leave it before this at a small cairn and keep high above the burn on its east side.\n\nThe path fades out but becomes clearer once more as the ground steepens for the grassy climb up Sròn Mhòr - the southern shoulder of Meall Greigh. Once above Sròn Mhòr there is a short peaty section before the ascent continues up the south ridge. The recompense for the effort is in the fine views of Loch Tay behind.\n\nMeall Greigh is rather a sprawling and shapeless Munro but its slightly detached position at the eastern end of the Lawers Range makes it an extensive viewpoint. Most eyes will be drawn west along the broad ridge to be followed to Meall Garbh, backed by steep An Stùc and massive Ben Lawers behind, with the tiny Lochan nan Cat cradled in front of them.\n\nDescend along the ridge - which is more of a moorland at this point - with a fenceline soon joining in from the right. Continue down to the bealach of Lairig Innein, where there is some wetter going in places. Beyond the bealach continue up the grassy slopes ahead.\n\nHigher up the ridge becomes better defined and curves round to the left to reach a rocky minor peak; continue beyond this to reach the cairn at the summit of Meall Garbh itself. This second Munro of the day is a mighty 1118 metres, its summit on second of the two parallel little ridges along the top. Ben Lawers now looms much closer but all eyes will be drawn to the next peak on the ridge - An Stùc - which rises intimidatingly steeply from the next bealach.\n\nContinue down the ridge to its foot. The ascent to this peak is a steep scramble and somewhat loose - great care is required, particularly in the wet. In winter this ascent can be very difficult indeed. The cairn at the summit will probably be reached with some relief. At 1118 metres An Stùc is exactly the same height as Meall Garbh; for many years this led to controversy as only the latter peak had Munro status. All was resolved in 1997 when An Stùc was itself promoted to be a Munro as well. Its status is well deserved as this is the finest peak in the Lawers range.\n\nContinue down the easier south ridge to reach Bealach Dubh. From here a decision must be made. It is possible to continue and include Ben Lawers to make a fine circuit of Lochan nan Cat, descending along its east ridge and then northeast to regain the path up to the corrie. Others (probably having climbed Lawers before) will have had enough, and will instead turn left at the bealach, following a rather winding path down an initial steep section of the descent.\n\nThere is a short grassy interlude before a final very steep descent down to the lochan - great care is needed. From here continue east along the exit stream, following it to a dam used by the Lawers hydro scheme. A track leaves here - follow it for a brief distance before onto a clear path that keeps high above the Lawers ravine. Further on the path descends into the ravine and crosses it before rejoining the outward route and leading back to the start.",

    "description": "The whole ridge on the south side of Glen Shiel is described as a single walk. Although a long day, this is the way most walkers tackle it. Note that this walk finishes around nine kilometres down the A87 from the start point, so you will probably want to arrange transport back up the glen, leave a bike, or try to time things for the bus service. Just east of the Cluanie Inn is the start of the old road from Cluanie to Tomdoun; it is possible to park fifty metres along this road. The walk begins by continuing along this private road soon crossing a bridge. At a fork keep right; the lower route goes to Cluanie Lodge. As the route climbs there are great views back over Loch Cluanie and the old road crosses a lovely stone bridge.\n\nContinue onwards all the way until a bealach.Even though it might feels wrong to lose height, this route is much easier going than crossing the rough pathless ground on the more direct line, so continue for another kilometre after the bealach. Just before another small bridge look out for a cairn on the right marking a stalkers path. The path climbs up zig-zags to the ridge, keep straight on where a smaller path, marked with a tiny cairn, forks left. There are great views back over Loch Loyne.\n\nThe summit of Creag a' Mhaim is the first Munro of the day at 947 metres. The most strenuous climb of the walk is now already behind, as the marvellous South Glen Shiel Ridge stretches ahead.\n\nThere is only a very short descent to the first col, after which the ridge begins to narrow on the gradual climb up to the second peak. The final section of ridge before the summit of Druim Shionnach is very narrow and rocky and can be avoided by using a bypass path just off to the left; you have now reached your second Munro at 987m.\n\nThe next peak is three kilometres further along the ridge, though the undulations are fairly gentle. There are great slabby crags sweeping down into the corries to the north, but the southern slopes are much gentler. The reward is your third Munro, Aonach air Chrith which at 1021m is the highest summit on the whole ridge. From here, most of the rest of the days ridge can be seen winding ahead. Shortly after the summit there is a narrow and rocky section of ridge (which can be bypassed) and soon a narrow grassy path enables a faster pace once more.\n\nThe ridge undulates over a couple of very minor summits before ascending to the fourth Munro, Maol Chinn-Dearg (981metres). From here the path along the ridge bypasses the top of the minor peak of Sgùrr Coire na Feinne before a long slow ascent to munro number five, Sgùrr an Doire Leathain (1010 metres).\n\nThe very summit of this mountain is a short distance along the northeast ridge and requires a slight detour NE. It has a fine view of the next peak, Sgùrr an Lochain which is the most distinctive on the whole ridge. Return to the main ridge, which now has good views down to the loch in Coire Lochain, and climbs easily up to Sgùrr an Lochain (1004 m).\n\nEnjoy the view from this sixth and finest Munro of the day before heading along the seemingly endless ridge once more. The next peak Sgùrr Beag is not a Munro and most walkers have worn a path which avoids its summit, passing to the south side, before the ridge drops to its lowest point at 729 metres with a little lochan. The climb up to the final Munro (Creag nan Dàmh) is likely to be a trial for worn-out limbs. Continue along the ridge and after a pronounced dip, take care on the short, straightforward, scramble up the far side.\n\nStay on the ridge for nearly 2km from the final peak, following the remains of a drystone dyke to the Bealach Duibh Leac where a small cairn marks where to turn north to start the steeper part of the descent. From here follow an old stalkers path, initially faint but marked by some small cairns at first, which winds down the northern slope and is boggy and rocky in places. Further down it becomes clearer and crosses, then leads down the west side of the Allt Coire Mhurlagain. Later on, keep the fence on your left and as the road in the bottom of the glen comes into view, the path forks. The main left branch leads to a ford over the burn, whilst the boggy right hand one veers away from the fence to reach an old footbridge at NG 970134. From here continue down through bracken, in the summer, to a gate leading to the A87. Now all you need to do is get back to your start point several km back up the busy road - there is a layby just to the right.",

    "description": "This route begins from Culra bothy; the walk in from Dalwhinnie to Culra is described separately. Culra bothy is closed due to the presence of asbestos so it is necessary to carry a tent and camp nearby. From Culra a faint path starts up the slope to the west towards Càrn Dearg, soon petering out. Continue up the steep heather slopes to the northwest; the going can be eased slightly by following the line of a grassy gully which is usually dry. When the slope eases, continue across rough ground until curving left to gain the ridge leading up towards Càrn Dearg, which gives much better going.\n\nThe summit of Càrn Dearg has fine views, with Ben Alder and its Leachas ridges having pride of place. Descend west; the ground soon becomes grassy as the route continues across a bealach and crosses the minor Top of An Diollaid. The ridge then descends to a second, lower bealach with some fine scenery.\n\nTo the right Coire Cheap with a circular lochan, whilst on the left the larger Loch an Sgoir is cradled by the spectacular Lancet Edge, whilst the route continues up steep Aisre Ghobhainn, with a path avoiding any problems. It emerges suddenly on a spacious, undulating grassy plateau. In poor conditions it could be difficult to locate the summit, which is marked by a small cairn around a kilometre WSW. From here, it is possible to shorten the walk, either by heading for the Lancet Edge for an exposed scrambly descent, or by heading for the Bealach Dubh.\n\nTo continue the walk to the next two Munros, follow the edge of the plateau WSW; it soon narrows and becomes an obvious ridge as it leads on to a high bealach at 1016 metres. The ascent to dome-like summit of Aonach Beag is short and straightforward; again the summit is marked by a small cairn.\n\nFollow the southwest ridge easily down to the next bealach. The descent route back for Culra leaves from here, but before taking it there is still Beinn Èibhinn to ascent. The first part of this climb is a little steeper, with some rocks, but there are no difficulties. After a slight dip the ridge rises more gently to the first of two summits, marked with the same height on OS 1:25 000 mapping; the second of them is regarded as the Munro, the fourth of the day.\n\nReturn back down the ridge to the last bealach. From here a faint path angles south to avoid some scree to reach grassier ground. Descend into Coire a'Charra Bhig, crossing and then keeping to the left of the stream. Before the bogs at the foot of the corrie are reached traverse the rough slopes to the left, keeping below the crags of Sròn Ruadh but above the peat. Once beyond the bogs drop down to the Allt Coire a'Laobhair and head for the stalkers path a short distance up the far slope. This is superbly maintained; turn left and follow it as it climbs over the Bealach Dubh. From here the path continues for a further 5.5km before reaching Culra bothy once more, crossing the Allt Loch an Sgoir along the way.",

Follow the main path up the glen into predominantly deciduous woodland. The path is very popular but the surface is still somewhat rugged and rocky in places. After a few hundred metres the glen curves to the right and narrows, with the cliffs across the river giving some of the feel of an Alpine gorge. The path continues up the glen and soon emerges from the trees.\n\nThe section of the more open glen ahead makes a tremendous view, with the green pastures of the valley floor surrounded by fine woodland backed by great mountains - with as centrepiece the great Steall falls, a tremendous waterfall where a stream cascades four hundred feet down a broken cliff into the glen. Keep on the main path, ignoring the turning on the right towards the cable bridge. As the path rounds the corner to the left it has superb views of the Falls just across the river.\n\nContinue on the now much quieter path up the glen for a further kilometre to a footbridge; cross this to reach the Steall ruins on the far side. These sad, crumbling remains are a reminder of a time when even the upper glen was inhabited. Turn off the main path here, and follow the faint path (which soon fades to nothing) which heads up the rough ground to the right of the Allt Coire nan Laogh.\n\nAs height is gained, bear right to climb onto the ridge which leads up towards Sgùrr a'Bhuic and avoids the complex ground at the back of Coire nan Laogh. Sgùrr a'Bhuic has excellent views across to the Grey Corries and the Mamores. Follow its northeast ridge down to the bealach before the steep climb along the edge of the cliffs to reach the higher summit of Stob Coire Bhealaich. From here the route descends slightly before beginning the final ascent to the great dome of Aonach Beag. This is a great viewpoint, with for Ben Nevis and Càrn Mòr Dearg magnificent to the west, a great tangle of peaks appearing in the direction of Glencoe, and a view between down Loch Linnhe towards the Isle of Mull.\n\nAlthough 'Beag' means small and 'Mòr' big, Aonach Beag is the higher of the two mountains; at 1234 metres it is the seventh highest summit in Britain. The name refers to the lesser bulk of the hill compared to the more massive Aonach Mòr to the north. From the summit, descend the initially broad and gentle slopes to the northwest. These slopes soon steepen (with a rough zig-zag path) and the ridge narrows to the tiny bealach connecting with the broader slopes of Aonach Mòr; this area would be tricky to navigate in mist, especially in winter.\n\nContinuing to the north, the slopes soon widen once more as a path leads up onto the great, flat, long but narrow plateau of Aonach Mòr, with impressive cliffs falling to the east. The summit, at 1221 metres, is in the very centre of this long plateau and again could be difficult to locate in mist; the view from the actual cairn is rather restricted by the flat surrounding slopes.\n\nIn such conditions, finding the descent route will be trickier still. Begin by retracing your steps towards Aonach Beag, but fork right on the way down to the bealach (there is a faint path in summer) to reach a couple of small cairns. The descent leads off the steep western side of the plateau from here, down a very steep ridge, to the 830 metre bealach between Aonach Mòr and Càrn Mòr Dearg; luckily there is a fairly clear though eroded path all the way down once the small cairn at the top is found. Once at the bealach, turn left and continue downhill into boggy Coire Guibhsachan. There is little sign of a path, but the grand scenery helps keeps the spirits from sinking.\n\nFollow the glen right down to Steall ruins where the outward route is joined.

    "description": "The starting point of the walk is the Glen Shiel car park (not layby) on the A87 east of a gap in the forestry, there is an information board about the Glen Shiel battle and a wooden Hill Path sign. Note that this is a one-way walk and you'll need to use public transport, bike, or a lift back up the road to return to this start point. Take the path west from the car park, soon turning right to follow a boggy path steeply up the slopes to the north keeping the forestry fence on your right. This first climb of the day is barely a kilometre long, but very steep as 550 metres have to be gained to reach the Bealach an Lapain.\n\nAt the corner of the forestry fence, turn left to head directly uphill on a fainter path marked with a tiny cairn. The route zigzags up the hillside above but never stops heading hard uphill until the Bealach na Lapain is reached with some relief. Turn right along the ridge.\n\nThe ridge has a well worn path and climbs very easily and directly to the summit cairn of Sàileag, at 956 metres. Sàileag feels fairly insignificant when compared with the other mountains on the ridge and given the short descent beyond the summit it is something of a surprise to find it is the first Munro of the day.\n\nContinue east along the ridge, descending just eighty metres or so to a col. Beyond there are a couple of minor summits to traverse before the start of a more prolonged climb up towards the next mountain.\n\nThis climb ends as the ridge levels off, turning southeast before the final gentle ascent to the summit ridge of Sgùrr a'Bhealaich Dheirg. There is a cairn at 1014 metres, but the actual summit of the mountain is a little further along the ridge. Continue along the ridge and then take the short arrete NE to reach the summit. Rocky, this short northeast ridge has drystone dyke built along it and a path on the east side. At 1038 metres, a fine cairn marks the true summit.\n\nRetrace your steps back to the main, broader ridge of the mountain before beginning a descent down the wide southeastern slopes, keeping the steeper slopes on your left, until the ridge becomes more distinctive once more as it turns east and drops again to the col at 827 metres. From the col, climb on a good path up to the 938 metre top, after which there is a small dip before the final climb to the summit of Munro number three, Aonach Meadhoin, at 1001 metres. From here, descend steeply at first before following a fine rocky ridge (bypass path on right in places) to the prominent top of Sgùrr an Fhuarail.\n\nMunro-baggers with plenty of energy may choose to descend the NNE ridge down to boggy Bealach a'Chòinich and to include Ciste Dhubh in the day, whilst others will be content and will descend the southeast ridge of Sgùrr an Fhuarail. The ridge descends simply at first, but it is necessary to traverse over a couple of minor summits to avoid the steep slopes on either side of the ridge.\n\nFrom the final bump at 843 metres, descend southwards, keeping the steepest ground to your left on the way down, before descending southeast to join the A87 opposite the Cluanie Inn. You are 7.5 kilometres from the start of the walk, so hopefully you've remembered to check the bus times or have arranged at lift!",

    "description": "There is a carpark (charge) on the left at the end of the public road towards the Linn of Quoich, 6km further along the road from the Linn of Dee. The quickest start is to head towards the bridge and almost immediately take the clear path turning sharply left and doubling back to climb up above the carpark into the old pinewoods. Ignore the path off right towards the Linn of Quoich, and then turn right onto the main track to begin the long walk in up Glen Quoich.\n\nFollowing the main track, continue up the glen. There are many magnificent old Scots pine trees in Glen Quoich, which must rank as amongst the most attractive in the Cairngorms. There is some regeneration in the lower glen but higher up regeneration is still poor. After a few kilometres the Linn of Quoich alternative start soon joins in from a footbridge on the right. Continue along the glen with Beinn a'Bhùird's huge bulk coming into view ahead on the right as the track curves round and passes below a plantation. Beyond this it crosses a small stream and a tiny path goes off left through the Clais Fhearnaig.\n\nContinue on the track to reach the Allt an Dubh-Ghleann. Even in summer this requires a paddle, and it would be quite impossible to cross in high spate - if the water level is high and fast then discretion is the better part of valour. On the far side keep on the main track, heading into the pinewoods below Càrn Allt na Beine. Soon the track now ends - the section of track from here to Beinn a'Bhùird was once one of the ugliest scars in the Highlands - a bull-dozed route visible for many miles around. However in recent years the National Trust for Scotland has done a fantastic job in beginning the restoration of the landscape and has helped the old track be recovered with heather.\n\nThe route now continues as a path climbing up above the woods and then across the hillside above. Higher up the new path built by NTS leaves the route of the former track completely when it zigzagged sharp left; continue on the fine new path which cuts across the slopes to eventually reach the ridge at An Diollaid. The shelter marked on maps here is just a roofless windbreak.\n\nContinue up the ridge - this section above the saddle of An Diollaid was once one of the worst parts of the scar, though the exposed location means it is taking longer for the vegetation to recolonise. The slopes soon broaden out and the gradient eases; there are great views across to the main Cairngorms, with the tors of Beinn Mheadhoin prominent. Bear right to head up onto the summit plateau of Beinn a'Bhùird.\n\nExcellent navigation is needed here if the weather is poor, but in good conditions you can venture to the edge of the plateau and look down into dramatic Coire an Dubh-Lochain, with its perfect lochan and the sculptured crags of Bloodhound Buttress. The south summit can be reached by a detour of about 700 metres from this point. Otherwise you can either follow the plateau edge towards where it narrows to a point, or take a more direct line to regain the edge above Coire nan Clach.\n\nThe summit is set well back from the edge of Coire nan Clach, away from the immediate drama of the precipices but with a grand prospect over endless rolling lower hills to the north, east and south; only to the west does the bulk of the main Cairngorms impinge on the distant horizon. It is possible to continue the walk to take in Ben Avon across the bealach of the Sneck; however, returning to the Linn of Quoich would make this a truly epic day requiring excellent fitness.\n\nAnother option is to head to the south summit and the Bruach Mhor before cutting across the moor to regain the track. Finally, returning by the same outward route with its easy going underfoot is the option taken by most walkers, and the fine pinewoods of Glen Quoich make this just as enjoyable as the ascent - it is the route we recommend.",

    "description": "From the back of the Linn of Dee car park a footpath signed for 'Glen Lui' heads into the woods. Follow this, passing a wooden lookout area and then a boardwalk built to ease the route across a boggy area. The path emerges onto a track a short distance beyond. Turn left along the track, which runs alongside a fenced section of forest at first before passing some beautiful pinewoods. After a couple of kilometres it crosses Black Bridge over the Lui to meet the main track to Derry Lodge. Turn left and follow this track up the glen.\n\nThe track continues up the glen, undulating slightly and passing some forestry on the right. Eventually the shelter belt of pines surrounding Derry Lodge come into view. Derry Lodge was a grand Victorian shooting lodge, used by Queen Victoria. This impressive building, which, like the rest of the estate, now belongs to the National Trust for Scotland, is boarded up and unused and has been for many years.\n\nDon't cross the bridge beyond the lodge but instead stay on the excellent path on the east side of Glen Derry; until recently this was a landrover track but the ground has been reinstated by the National Trust. As the path turns north up the glen, continue through the forest for a couple of kilometres to where the path reaches a high point before descending slightly to a small cairn - about 40m after a small burn. Turn right up through the trees at this point, following a narrow but clear path that leads towards the bealach between Meall Lunndain and Beinn Bhreac; it is boggy as it heads up through and out of the trees.\n\nHigher up the path becomes drier for a time and is joined by another coming in from the right. It heads over a curious hummock above the bealach before a final climb up more soggy slopes towards the plateau between the two tops of Beinn Bhreac. The summit is the more easterly of these, marked by a large cairn. There are good views back down to the pinewoods of Glen Derry as well as out towards Lochnagar.\n\nThe vast tablelands of the Moine Bhealaidh now stretch ahead for several kilometres, with Beinn a'Chaorainn visible in the distance. Pick up a path from between the two summits of Beinn Bhreac that keeps to the east side of vast areas of peaty ground, decorated with cottongrass. The path peters out in a boggy area before improving again, before finally vanishing in a second bog. From here aim for the stony southeastern shoulder of Beinn a'Chaorainn, thankfully giving drier going.\n\nClimb these final slopes to reach the large cairn at the summit of Beinn a'Chaorainn at 1083 metres. The extra height makes the view much more extensive than that from Beinn Bhreac, with Ben Macdui, highest of the Cairngorms, in view to the left of the numerous granite tors of Beinn Mheadhoin. The best descent route is down the southwest shoulder at first.\n\nThe very steep final slope down towards the summit of the Lairig an Laoigh is slightly easier if you head further south. Once you reach the Lairig, turn left down this path as it slopes down into upper Glen Derry, with some great views across the upper glen into Coire Etchachan.\n\nOnce the floor of the glen is reached the path is joined by the broad path coming down from Coire Etchachan and the Hutchison Memorial Hut. Continue down the path to soon reach the considerable side-stream of the Glas Allt Mòr . This can usually be crossed using stepping stones but can be quite impossible if the stream is in full spate. Beyond this the empty glen continues for several kilometres before reaching the beginning of the Derry pinewoods. Stay on the east bank to rejoin the outward route and eventually lead back to Derry Lodge. From here, return to the Linn of Dee using your outward route.",

The track soon bends left and later to the right (where there is another option to follow a path off to join the route by the river). Beyond this the track reaches a junction. Turn left here and continue to eventually reach the forest edge, where the riverside 'path' rejoins.\n\nContinue through the first soggy field to a gate and stile, and then bear right through another gate to reach the open slopes.

There's a deer fence across the hillside which is crossed at a stile. Beyond it the ascent continues, now on drier ground. There are stunning views looking back to Loch Treig and to the hill ranges across the glen, with the Grey Corries looking particularly fine.\n\nContinue up the fairly featureless mountainside until the southern top of Beinn a'Chaorainn is finally reached, marked by a cairn. From here the walk improves greatly, with some stunning views down into the corries on the right, and Creag Meagaidh beyond. The walk continues easily in summer across a slight dip to reach the central, Munro summit at 1052 metres. There have been several accidents to walkers in winter taking a bearing between these two summits and falling through the cornice into the corrie, so in such conditions be careful to keep safely away from the edge, both on this stretch and that to the north top.\n\nContinue this fine traverse, curving round another perfect arc to reach the northern summit at 1043 metres, and a final look back across the corries.\n\nFrom here, begin the descent northwards at first before slanting down increasingly wet ground towards Tom Mòr , at the bealach between Beinn a'Chaorainn and Beinn Teallach. The height lost is very considerable, but there is some encouragement in that Beinn Teallach is a much lower hill.\n\nRound the steep lower slope of Beinn Teallach to the right before beginning a direct climb up the north-northeast ridge. There is a faint path for most of the way; the upper section of the ridge has many rocky knolls and outcrops. There are two cairns on the summit; the first is reckoned to be highest but the second is finer.\n\nBeinn Teallach is now known to be 915 metres but was for many years regarded as below 3000 feet, until in 1984 it changed from being one of the highest Corbetts; it is now the lowest of the Munros. Descend the easy southern slopes before curving round to the left to reach the Allt a'Chaorainn lower down. A deer fence is crossed at a gate.\n\nThe stream can be quite tricky to cross, so may be best to try to reach the east bank as high up as possible; in wet conditions you may need to detour north up the glen to find an easy crossing. Once on the far side, a faint and soggy path leads down the glen to eventually return to the forest track and then retrace your steps back to the start of the walk.",

Follow the track; there is a branch off to the left just before the main track heads through the trees to some houses - take this branch to continue across the moor. There are soon great views to the right over a wide meander in the Abhain Guilbinn to the distant Grey Corries.

The track now leads into a wild area with Beinn a'Chlachair ahead on the left and the distant peaks of the Aonach Beag range to its right. When the track forks, keep left, passing to the left of a small reservoir. Follow the track to the southern end of Lochan na h-Earba, crossing the bridge over its feeder stream. There is a stunning sandy beach on the left just beyond looking up the deep trench-like glen holding the two lochs.\n\nThe main track now runs along the head of the loch before swinging to the right in a loop. Look out for a small cairn that indicates the start of a grassy path which is a short-cut to the main stalkers path you now need to follow. Join this and follow it uphill; it soon runs alongside the Allt Coire Pitridh. The surface has been improved in places and the path is almost as good as a track. Pass some ruined shielings and higher up cross a feeder stream coming down from the east. About half a kilometre further up, leave this excellent path and cross the Allt Coire Pitridh, heading up the steep grassy bank on the far side. The ground ahead is boggy in places; make a bee-line across it to the south. Beyond climb the initially very steep slopes ahead, bearing a little to the right to reach the eastern rim of Coire Mòr Chlachair higher up. The corrie is quite a dramatic scoop out of the mountain and the summit of Beinn a'Chlachair comes into view across it.\n\nContinue round the rim of the corrie, passing to the left (or over) a rocky wart prominent in some distant views. The ground is a mixture of loose stones and grassy patches and the slope becomes easier as it finally merges into the spacious plateau of Beinn a'Chlachair. The summit is at the far side of the corrie; there is briefly a path before the final stony slopes are reached leading to the large cairn with a windshelter on the northwest side. At 1087 metres this is the highest of the three Munros and the view is probably the most extensive. Chno Dearg is the nearest prominent peak to the west, backed by the impressive Easains and the Grey Corries. South is the very remote Aonach Beag range whilst to the east are the two peaks making up the rest of the days walk - Geal Chàrn looks (and is!) a long way from here. Head back down the stony slope and then continue across the plateau towards it - there is a path on the grassy sections though it is lost on the stones.\n\nThe plateau ends abruptly in cliffs above Loch a'Bhealaich Leamhain. The descent is to the north, either directly down the corner of the slopes towards the Bhealach Leamhain - which is very steep and rocky, requiring some scrambling and route finding, or a couple of hundred metres further west where the descent to the north is just as steep but grassier. If taking this latter option, once easier ground is reached you can traverse to the right to meet the stalkers path from the bealach rather than continuing directly down over the bogs. Follow the path to the left to reach the stalkers path junction of Coire Pitridh.\n\nHere turn right to trace the excellent path heading north over the col between Creag Pitridh and Geal Chàrn. Stay on this path for around half a kilometre until it begins to traverse the slopes and a convenient place is reached to leave it and head directly for Geal Chàrn. The slopes are easy at first with a few stony sections higher up. There are a couple of false summits - Geal Chàrn seems further than might be expected - but eventually the true summit comes into view ahead. This has its own name - Mullach Coire an Iubhair - and consists of a small stony cone topped with a very well-built cairn (and a trig point behind); a fine summit for such a sprawling mountain. The best parts of the view are back to Beinn a'Chlachair and the more distant view east towards the Cairngorms. Return back along the ridge before diverting to the right to reach the bealach below Creag Pitridh. This peak looks tiny compared to its mighty neighbours - a mere bump on the slopes of Geal Chàrn, but on closer acquaintance it begins to look very steep.\n\nAt the bealach the stalkers path is reached once more; cross over it. Luckily there is a path up Creag Pitridh, making the ascent much more straightforward; this aims straight for the top at first before dog-legging left and then finally to the right across quartzite rocks to the summit. Although only 924 metres it has perhaps the most beautiful view of the three Munros, with the two Lochan na h-Earba and Loch Laggan prominent. For the descent, follow a path at first to the west which leads down the steeper upper section. Once the flatter shoulder is reached bear left off the ridge to make a long descent of straightforward, mostly grassy slopes. Aim for the confluence where the stream from the bealach meets the Allt Coire Pitridh - this avoids boggy ground further east. At the confluence the stalkers path from the outward route is joined. Turn right along this and retrace your steps all the way back to the start.",

The shortest route to it is from Glen Lochy, enabling easy inclusion of its less impressive neighbour Beinn a'Chlèibh.",
    "description": "Park in the car park (charge) off to the left of the A85 at NN239278. A good path leaves this and heads for the river Lochy. The path goes to the right along the bank of the river - head along it, looking for the most convenient place to cross. The Lochy is a wide river but usually shallow enough to wade; it can be crossed easily in very dry conditions, whilst in spate any crossing would be very dangerous or even impossible. On the far side is the railway - crossing over the lines here is a criminal offence. Instead use the low bridge through which the Eas Dàimh flows under the line to join the Lochy - here a metal grid provides access for walkers that should keep your feet dry in most conditions (again, impassable in spate); you will need to stoop!\n\nThe path continues through a felled area and then through the trees alongside the burn. After 500m a confluence of burns is reached - ensure you cross the Eas Dàimh here and instead follow the burn from the Fionn Choire beyond - both burns have paths alongside. Soon after this, in another felled area, cross the Fionn Choire burn to reach and pass through a gate in a deer fence. From just beyond this a rough track leads uphill through cleared forest until you reach a main forest track at around 300m. Turn left along this until reaching a bridge over the Fionn Choire; immediately after this turn right onto a path that again heads up steeply through the trees. Some sections are very boggy.\n\nThe path thankfully leaves the forestry at a metal gate at around 490 metres in Fionn Choire. From here you could make directly for the bealach between the two peaks, but it gives more variety to leave that route for the descent. Instead climb directly to the east - a featureless, initially soggy, pathless and unremitting but mostly grassy ascent that leads eventually to the north ridge of Ben Lui. There are great views looking back over Glen Lochy.\n\nFrom here the climb becomes much more enjoyable; turn right up the still steep ridge, rocky in places, which becomes increasingly well defined. There is a cairn marking the northwest summit, and walkers coming up from the ridge enclosing Coire Gaothach join the route here.\n\nThe higher southeastern summit is a short distance further across a dip. At 1130m Ben Lui is one of the highest and probably the finest Munro in the southern Highlands. The cairn has a magnificent situation right on the edge of the great Coire Gaothach which usually holds snow into early summer and has a classic winter climb known as Central Gully - for mountaineers.\n\nFrom here the neighbouring Munro of Beinn a'Chlèibh looks quite insignificant. To begin the descend down the broad ridge towards it, retrace your steps off the summit to find the top of a path. This leads down a long, broad slope to reach the bealach.\n\nFrom the bealach the zig-zags its way up the ridge beyond to reach the spacious plateau; the summit is marked by a cairn at 916m. Beinn a'Cheibh seems quite an anti-climax after Ben Lui but it too looks a fine peak when seen from the A85 road to the north; it presents a fierce rocky wall in this direction, so it is best to return to the bealach above Coire Fionn.\n\nEnjoy the last of the days fine views, over towards Ben Cruachan. The initial descent from the bealach is very steep so care should be taken. Further down the terrain becomes much easier and follows the Fionn Choirein burn directly down to where the path emerged from the forest at the steel gate early in the day. Retrace your outward route back down through the trees to the start. You probably won't mind getting wet feet in the Lochy for the last few metres to the car park.",

From here walk along the road away from the A85 for a very short distance and turn left over a cattle grid onto a track, near some pine trees. Follow the track, keeping left at a fork. Bear left when the track divides and the way ahead goes through a gate leading to Castles Farm. You are now on the track connected to the Cruachan Dam hydro scheme which has tunnels under Beinn a'Chochuill. Go through a gate and start heading uphill on the track.\n\nThe track climbs on an easy gradient before descending slightly to cross the Allt Lairig lanachan. Soon afterwards at a junction take the track to the right and continue for a short distance until the least steep section of the ridge above is reached. Turn left to climb up the grassy slope in a north-west direction, there is a faint path which becomes clearer as the ridge becomes more defined. The views back over the head of Loch Awe and Kilchurn Castle are worth stopping to admire every now and again. Eventually the main ridge is reached with a good view down to Glen Kinglas on the other side.\n\nFollow the narrow path west along the ridge, climbing past a rocky outcrop before a more gentle section of ridge before the final pull up the grassy slope to the summit of Beinn a'Chochuill at 980 metres. From here retrace your steps along the ridge and at the point where you joined the ridge continue eastwards, along the grassy ridge, towards the bealach Lairig lanachan at 728m.\n\nHere the whole route up Beinn Eunaich can be seen, a straightforward ascent on a grassy and stone slope with a faint path. There are good views down Glen Kinglass, deserted except for the buildings at Glenkinglas Lodge. At 989 metres, Beinn Eunaich is a similar height to the first Munro, however this one has better views back over Beinn a'Chochuill to the Cruachan ridge and beyond, and down to Loch Awe. There is a sizeable cairn on the summit.\n\nBegin the descent by heading directly for the head of Loch Awe, south from the summit cairn. The ridge is grassy and fairly broad. In dry weather the going is good with springy turf underfoot, there is a faint path. Keep following the ridge with good views of Kilchurn Castle ahead. The route crosses a couple of peat hags and shortly after the path bears right to head southwest down very steep ground.\n\nIt may also be possible to continue a little further along the ridge and descend the slightly less steep ground, however there are crags which mean you have to come off the slope before the end and therefore it may be easier to follow the very steep and loose path. The path winds downhill becoming eroded and stony in places until it emerges onto the track below.

    "description": "Turn off the A82 along the track towards Achaladair Farm where there is a walkers car park just 150m from the main road. This walk can be done in either direction but a clockwise circuit gives perhaps the finest views ahead, so walk along the track to the hardstanding near the farm. Keep to the left side of the hardstanding to pass through a gate onto a grassy track. This runs through a field beside a stone wall before passing through a gate to reach a ford over the Allt Ur. This can usually be crossed with dry feet but it may be impossible in spate (in which case there is a bridge upstream just above the farm).\n\nContinue on the track until it reaches a bridge over the Water of Tulla. Our route from here crosses the bridge and continues along the track - but note that the footbridges shown on maps upstream no longer exist, so check water levels to be confident you'll be able to make the crossing. (If the Water of Tulla is high, you can stay on the south side until after the Allt na Crannaich and then follow a path through the trees to pass under the railway, then turning left after a deer fence to regain the route described here in the next paragprah). If following our main route, you'll see the ruined farm of Tom na Grobh ahead; keep on the main track by turning right. There are great views of the days mountains across the Water of Tulla. After another two kilometres leave the track, heading down to the right to the river. Only two twisted girders remain of the old bridge, but in dry conditions you can cross the river just upstream.\n\nOnce over the river the route enters the Black Wood of Rannoch. This is a celebrated remnant of the ancient Caledonian forest which once covered most of Scotland, with a mix of fine Scots pines lower down and birches higher up. The path heads to the left, keeping well above the river; it soon becomes boggy underfoot in parts. You'll see where the burn flows under the railway to your left; continue up to reach a gate and pedestrian underpass beaneath the track. As part of the West Highland line, the railway is considered the most scenic in Britain. Follow the path alongside the deer fence; ignore the two stiles (where the alternative route mentioned above joins back in) and continue uphill close to the burn. There are great views through to the right across to Beinn Achaladair, looking magnificent above the pines.\n\nThe path continues by the cascading stream up into Coire an Lochain. You can continue right up to the lochan, or cross the burn a little earlier, to head up the open, pathless slopes to the left of the cliffs around the head of the corrie.\n\nAs height is gained the views back become increasingly beautiful, initially across Rannoch Moor and later down onto Lochan a'Chreachain - a stunning lochan cradled by the corrie headwall. The north ridge of Beinn a'Chreachain is reached at about 900 metres. Turn right along the fine ridge which curves left just before reaching the summit.\n\nThe summit of Beinn a'Chreachain is marked by a well-built cairn at 1081 metres, the highest peak in the Beinn Dòrain range of four Munros. It is a very fine viewpoint; Rannoch Moor looks impressively wild and empty, backed by distant Ben Nevis and with a great view up the length of Loch Ericht. Southeast is Loch Lyon, with Ben Lawers the distant dominant peak surrounded by its many satellites. Continue the walk by descending steeply towards the bealach with the neighbouring summit of Meall Buidhe. The descent is initially stony but becomes grassier as the bealach is reached.\n\nFrom here a clear path heads off to the left, appearing to contour round Meall Buidhe; this path is not continuous however and it is probably easier as well as more enjoyable to follow the grassy ridge over this minor summit, making the most of the views over Rannoch Moor. Beyond Meall Buidhe the ridge descends to the Bealach an Aoghlainn. The ridge leading up the other side to Beinn Achaladair looks (and is) very steep in its lower section, but there is a path. This starts a little to the right and winds its way up the steep grass with a couple of rocky sections. Higher up the slope eases and curves to the right for the final climb up to Beinn Achaladair's summit.\n\nA cairn positioned right by the edge of the northern precipices is it the finest viewpoint but the actual summit is slightly further on at 1038m. There is no better place from which to look out over the vast desolation of Rannoch Moor, with the Black Wood as a foreground far below, whilst further left is an aerial view of Loch Tulla backed by mighty Stob Ghabhar. Continue the walk along the now gentle grassy ridge which gradually curves round to the south, ascending slightly at one point before continuing down to the bealach above Coire Daingean. From here it is possible to continue the walk by ascending the ridge ahead to Beinn an Dòthaidh, but most walkers will have had enough. A fairly clear path descends north from the bealach into Coire Daingean, negotiating a route through the rough hummocky ground.\n\nThe path keeps to the east side of the burn as it descends from the upper corrie past some pretty waterfalls, before crossing to the west side just beyond a steep section. The going is boggy in places but the path is fairly clear, crossing one feeder which has a steep rocky bank on the far side. The path - which is now both eroded and boggy - otherwise continues easily down Coire Achaladair. Towards the bottom the path runs to the left of a fenced area and then crosses the railway via a bridge in a picturesque patch of woodland. Looking back Beinn an Dòthaidh looks magnificent. Continue down until a signpost indicates where to bear left on a boggy path over humpy ground to return to the car park.",

Follow the track as it crosses the River Falloch on a bridge and continue on the track heading gently uphill, passing through a gate. Ahead you can see the grassy flank of Sròn Gharbh. This is the first objective on the way to the summit of An Caisteal. The path up the ridge is now blocked by wire mesh blocking what was a gate, so instead follow the track for a kilometre to reach and pass through a gate, then turn right alongside the fence (no path) for 200m to join the path after the blocked gateway. Now turn left along the rough path; this first section of ascent is easy going with a couple of very short rocky steep sections and great views back.\n\nFurther up there is a faint path with becomes clearer as the first top of Sròn Gharbh is reached. From here there is a fairly clear path to Sròn Gharbh and beyond up the ridge well-named Twistin Hill. The path follows the meandering ridge as it climbs steadily with lumpy rocky sections every now and again. About two thirds of the way along there is a deep cleft, easily crossed on a path requiring a couple of steep steps. The path then heads around a rocky knoll before climbing to the summit of An Caisteal (995m).\n\nFrom the summit continue south on a small path that follows the clear ridge. At a couple of places there are rocky steps that are easily negotiated. The Bealach Buidhe is soon reached. From here the path traverses diagonally south east to head slightly right from the bealach up a rocky slope. The path winds up the steep buttress of Beinn a'Chròin, with one short section of scrambling (avoidable by an awkward detour to the right) to reach the plateau.\n\nFrom here the path is straightforward as it winds between rocky lumps and tiny lochans - a small cairn marks the true highest point of the mountain. After a final steep dip there is a short steep section before the small cairn on the eastern summit is reached. Just before the top, a fainter path joins from the left - this is the return route.\n\nFrom the eastern summit there are wide ranging views over the Trossachs and further east and north. Leave by heading north back down the path you came on for a short distance and then continuing straight ahead down the grassy ridge. There is a faint path for most of the descent, which is a little eroded on some of the steeper sections. Aim for the point where the two streams meet and cross them just before the confluence.\n\nFrom here there is a path following the west side of the River Falloch. The River has some lovely clear pools which can be inviting on a hot day. The route reaches a hydro works and then joins a hydro track that leads back to rejoin the outward route.

    "description": "Beinn Dòrain is a peak which has long been admired by passing travellers as it so dominates the route north. It was famously celebrated in the poem Moladh Beinn Dobhrainn (In Praise of Beinn Dòrain) by the eighteenth century Gaelic poet Duncan Ban MacIntyre, who wrote of its 'blooms in agreement, like a great music' - anticipating the modern outlook of ecology. There is a car park close by the hotel in Bridge of Orchy. Begin the walk by crossing the road and following the lane signed for the train station.\n\nFollow the lane to the right (ignoring the level crossing ahead) towards the station, following the West Highland Way. Pass under both sides of the railway line using the underpass. Go through a gate onto a track, and then leave the West Highand Way, crossing the main track and instead taking a stony one to pass to the left of a transmitter mast. The broad path continues uphill, and then forks. Take the right hand branch, which climbs the moorland keeping to the right of the Allt an Dòthaidh. It is a pleasant climb up into the grassy bowl of Coire an Dòthaidh, surrounded by wide slopes dotted with crags.\n\nThe climb out of the corrie involves a steeper section of path. There's then an upper coire before the final climb up to the bealach at 744m. From the bealach the view to the east reveals a glimpse of Loch Lyon in the remotest reaches of Perthshire.\n\nBoth Munros can be tackled from here, and it matters little which you climb first. For Beinn Dòrain, follow the path that clibms southwards, passing over some slabby rocks at first, before gaining a grassier plateau. Continue along the path which twists and turns before climbing up to gain a better defined ridge.\n\nThe path forks at one point - the right hand branch keeps below the ridge and passes to the west of both the summits before cutting back to the top from the far side. It's better to stay on the main, left-hand, path which continues along the ridge a large cairn. In mist many mistake this for the summit, but actually this is Càrn Sasunnaich (the Englishman's Cairn and perhaps a suggestion that Gael's have little respect for the navigational skills of those from the south of the border).\n\nOn the main path, continue from Sasunnaich to the next bealach and then follow the ridge up to the true summit of Beinn Dòrain. At 1076 metres this is a great viewpoint, especially around the southern arc, whilst Loch Lyon is well seen to the northeast. Return along the ridge to the bealach above Coire an Dòthaidh.\n\nThis time follow the path towards Beinn an Dòthaidh. This climbs northeast across the slopes at first to avoid a steep section; beyond it the path continues up very broad and grassy slopes before becoming boggy and somewhat lost around Coire Reidh. Continue across the boggy area to regain a path which climbs up to the bealach between the main summit of Beinn an Dòthaidh and its more distinct southern top.\n\nHead north to reach the true summit of Beinn an Dòthaidh at 1004m. It has a fine view over Rannoch Moor (with Ben Nevis beyond if the day is clear). However, it would be a real shame to come this far and miss the best view on the mountain, which is from the west top just a short walk away.\n\nCross the gentle slopes west to reach the large cairn at around 1000m; the finest view of all is from a small cairn just NW on the edge of the crags, with a magnificent outlook over Loch Tulla, with Stob Ghabhar and its satellite peaks looking magnificent behind. From here you can descend gentle slopes back into Coire Reidh to rejoin the path, and then follow this back down to the bealach.

    "summary": "Ben Alder is one of the great remote mountains of Scotland, set in the very heart of the Central Highlands. Approaches are long from any direction; Corrour Station gives the nearest access from the west, whilst it is possible to approach from Loch Rannoch in the south. The finest approach, however, is from Culra bothy (closed but you can camp nearby) to the northeast, accessed via a long walk-in or cycle from Dalwhinnie.",
    "description": "This route begins from Culra bothy; the walk in from Dalwhinnie to Culra is described separately. Culra bothy is closed due to the presence of asbestos so it is necessary to carry a tent and camp nearby. From Culra Ben Alder looks magnificent, with two rocky ridges - the Short and Long Leachas, enclosing a hanging corrie. This route follows the ridge on the right - the Long Leachas and gives some very simple scrambling. Start in the opposite direction, following the track back downstream for just over 300 metres to reach and cross the bridge over the Allt a'Chaoil-reidhe. On the far side follow the grassy path to meet the superbly maintained stalkers' path, and turn right up this to begin the walk towards Ben Alder. After almost 2 kilometres the path bends left away from the river and climbs up the moorland towards Beinn Bheòil. Look out for a small cairn at NN515744 which marks a convenient place to leave the path and strike out across the heather.\n\nA faint path runs across the slope and eases the going at first. Drop slightly to cross the Allt a'Bhealaich Bheithe, which can be done on stones when the water is low but may be difficult in spate. Continue across the rough moor beyond, aiming to reach the Long Leachas just to the left of a slight hummock on the ridge. Once on the ridge there is path. The ridge can appear intimidating, but the path winds up the first very steep rise, weaving between crags with no real difficulties. The ridge then levels off before a second steep rise that looks to be barred near the top by crags.\n\nAt this point the path heads to the right before climbing back up to the ridge crest via a scrabbly gully. Beyond the ridge is narrow and rocky but any real difficulties can be easily avoided before the route emerges suddenly on the stony plateau beyond. Continue across this, keeping the crags to the left and climbing up past the top of the Short Leachas ridge. The going now becomes a little grassier and there are good views down to Loch a' Bhealaich Bheithe to Beinn Bheòil, before finally a rougher pull over boulders leads up to the summit of Ben Alder, marked by a trig point in a windshelter cairn with a much larger cairn alongside. The stone ruin just north below the summit is all that remains of a camp set up by Major General Thomas Fredrick Colby as part of the original Ordnance Survey mapping party.\n\nContinue round the plateau edge (careful navigation needed in mist), which bends to the left shortly after passing Lochan a'Garbh Choire; there are great views over the Garbh Choire. After passing spot height 1103m (OS 1:25k map, or marked with a 1100m contour ring on OS 1:50k) leave the cliffs and head to head southeast. From NN502705 descend down steep, rough slopes by a burn to reach the Bealach Breabag, with good views of Loch Ericht and Rannoch Moor beyond. It is important not to follow the edge of the plateau as it curves further east and then north as this leads out onto a prow from where cliffs bar any descent to the bealach.\n\nFrom the bealach it is possible to cut the walk short by heading north and following a stalkers path back to Culra. To include Beinn Bheòil in the walk, however, follow a faint path up the slopes of Sròn Coire na h-Iolaire. It is possible to bypass this summit of this Top on the left before following a narrowing ridge down to a bealach and then on up past a rocky knobble before reaching the cairn marking the summit of Beinn Bheòil.\n\nFrom the summit there are excellent views both back to Ben Alder and along the length of Loch Ericht, with a glimpse of distant Dalwhinnie. Continue along the ridge for another 750 metres or so before bearing left down the slope once past the screes. Continue WNW down the moor, aiming to meet the stalkers path close to where it changes direction. Once gained the path gives excellent walking back to the bridge over the river and Culra bothy.",

    "summary": "This pair of Munros lies between the Beinn a'Bhùird and Ben Avon massifs and the main mass of the High Cairngorms. Often overlooked, they are separated by the sprawling Moine Bhealaidh, a featureless plateau, but the pinewoods of Glen Derry provides a fine approach and the views are good.",
    "description": "From the back of the Linn of Dee car park a footpath signed for 'Glen Lui' heads into the woods. Follow this, passing a wooden lookout area and then a boardwalk built to ease the route across a boggy area. The path emerges onto a track a short distance beyond. Turn left along the track, which runs alongside a fenced section of forest at first before passing some beautiful pinewoods. After a couple of kilometres it crosses Black Bridge over the Lui to meet the main track to Derry Lodge. Turn left and follow this track up the glen.\n\nThe track continues up the glen, undulating slightly and passing some forestry on the right. Eventually the shelter belt of pines surrounding Derry Lodge come into view. Derry Lodge was a grand Victorian shooting lodge, used by Queen Victoria. This impressive building, which, like the rest of the estate, now belongs to the National Trust for Scotland, is boarded up and unused and has been for many years.\n\nDon't cross the bridge beyond the lodge but instead stay on the excellent path on the east side of Glen Derry; until recently this was a landrover track but the ground has been reinstated by the National Trust. As the path turns north up the glen, continue through the forest for a couple of kilometres to where the path reaches a high point before descending slightly to a small cairn - about 40m after a small burn. Turn right up through the trees at this point, following a narrow but clear path that leads towards the bealach between Meall Lunndain and Beinn Bhreac; it is boggy as it heads up through and out of the trees.\n\nHigher up the path becomes drier for a time and is joined by another coming in from the right. It heads over a curious hummock above the bealach before a final climb up more soggy slopes towards the plateau between the two tops of Beinn Bhreac. The summit is the more easterly of these, marked by a large cairn. There are good views back down to the pinewoods of Glen Derry as well as out towards Lochnagar.\n\nThe vast tablelands of the Moine Bhealaidh now stretch ahead for several kilometres, with Beinn a'Chaorainn visible in the distance. Pick up a path from between the two summits of Beinn Bhreac that keeps to the east side of vast areas of peaty ground, decorated with cottongrass. The path peters out in a boggy area before improving again, before finally vanishing in a second bog. From here aim for the stony southeastern shoulder of Beinn a'Chaorainn, thankfully giving drier going.\n\nClimb these final slopes to reach the large cairn at the summit of Beinn a'Chaorainn at 1083 metres. The extra height makes the view much more extensive than that from Beinn Bhreac, with Ben Macdui, highest of the Cairngorms, in view to the left of the numerous granite tors of Beinn Mheadhoin. The best descent route is down the southwest shoulder at first.\n\nThe very steep final slope down towards the summit of the Lairig an Laoigh is slightly easier if you head further south. Once you reach the Lairig, turn left down this path as it slopes down into upper Glen Derry, with some great views across the upper glen into Coire Etchachan.\n\nOnce the floor of the glen is reached the path is joined by the broad path coming down from Coire Etchachan and the Hutchison Memorial Hut. Continue down the path to soon reach the considerable side-stream of the Glas Allt Mòr . This can usually be crossed using stepping stones but can be quite impossible if the stream is in full spate. Beyond this the empty glen continues for several kilometres before reaching the beginning of the Derry pinewoods. Stay on the east bank to rejoin the outward route and eventually lead back to Derry Lodge. From here, return to the Linn of Dee using your outward route.",

    "summary": "The bulky mountains of Beinn Bhrotain and Monadh Mòr are well out of sight and probably out of mind from Glen Feshie. In good weather, however, they can be climbed via a long high-level traverse over the Moine Mhòr plateau.",
    "description": "Take the road up the east side of Glen Feshie (signed Achlean); just after the road leaves the forest there is a good size car park on the left, about a kilometre short of Achlean itself, where parking is not permitted. Begin the walk along the tarmac road, turning left on a track before reaching Achlean. Ignore the track that heads left to a mast, and keep left at the fork a short distance further on, with a Càrn Ban Mòr stone marker. Follow this path to reach a gate at the edge of a plantation. Pass through the gate; the path immediately forks; take the main, left hand branch. This climbs quite steeply through the trees before reaching more open ground above; there are stunning views up Glen Feshie over to the right.\n\nThe path, which is very clear and well worn, climbs around the hillside towards the col between point 783 metres and Càrn Ban Mòr ; it then continues up the ridge, soon joined by an older path which zig-zags up from the slope below. The views back across Badenoch are superb, with a vast array of mountains in clear weather. Creag Meagaidh is easily identified by the deep gash of the Window to the right of its summit. The path comes close to a tiny stream before swinging slightly to the left (ignore the faint trod up beside the stream). Further on is a more obvious path junction, marked by a cairn; take the right hand option here. A left turn is a possible start to an ascent of Sgòr Gaoith.\n\nThe path has now crossed the watershed and there are good views of the Cairngorms giants such as Braeriach and the distinctive flat-topped cone of Cairn Toul. The path heads downhill to the southeast, before climbing towards spot height 957 metres on the OS map; it is worth following uphill to avoid a bog. This is the heart of the Moine Mhor, a great wild plateau that extends for many kilometres; unfortunately the wilderness feel is rather spoiled when an ugly constructed landrover track is reached. Turn left down this track (to the right it heads for Coire Garbhlach and Mullach Clach a'Bhlàir).\n\nThe track descends to the east before ending quite abruptly just short of a grassy ravine carrying the headwaters of the River Eidart. Continue directly across this (or bear left to cross slightly higher up before swinging back) - the burn can usually be crossed using stones. Ascend the bog on the far side and then head ESE to reach the featureless bealach marked as point 876 metres on OS maps. Faint grassy vehicle tracks continue from here, bypassing the cairn on the summit of Tom Dubh, one of Britain's remotest tops.\n\nContinue east downhill (grassy tyre tracks help avoid the bogs) to reach the Allt Luinneag. This is a surprisingly substantial burn to find at such an altitude, and often requires a paddle across; in spate, it could be difficult or dangerous. On the far side, continue east, now climbing uphill across slopes of grass interspersed with granite rocks, to gain the very broad north ridge of Monadh Mòr . Follow this SSE for a kilometre to reach the cairn on the summit. The views are extensive, with the Devil's Point guarding the left side of Glen Geuchasan which stretches away to the east, backed by Deeside and mighty Lochnagar. Beinn Bhrotain is also now visible, a bouldery dome defended with crags on its northern flanks.\n\nCheck the time at this point as if Beinn Bhrotain is included in the walk it is necessary to return all the way back over Monadh Mòr . If going for it a faint path passes to the left of the 1110m top before becoming clear on the steep descent to the narrow bealach at 975 metres. The views to the left here of Glen Geusachan are the most dramatic of the walk.\n\nThe path continues up the far side for some distance before reaching the vast boulder fields; continue up the boulders directly to reach the summit of Beinn Bhrotain, marked by two large windshelter cairns, one of them protecting a trig point. The views are even more extensive than those from Monadh Mòr .\n\nIf transport is not a problem then it is possible to descend the southeastern flanks and walk out to the Linn of Dee - which is a huge distance from Glen Feshie by road. The quickest return to Glen Feshie is to retrace your steps all the way back, including the reascent of Monadh Mòr and across the flanks of Carn Ban Mòr . The very fit could extend the route slightly by following the landrover track that eventually descends by Coire Garbhlach, perhaps detouring to the summit of Mullach Clach a'Bhlàir. If the weather is kind then the walk back may be greatly enjoyed, but if the wind gets up or the mists roll in, it will be a battle.",

    "summary": "Beinn Bhuidhe is a Munro isolated from any others, and the long walk in means it is much less visited than the nearby Arrochar Alps, despite it having rough and rocky slopes in places. The approach described here is the traditional one following a private road up the glen (can be cycled) and then a rugged ascent; it is possible instead to make use of an ugly new hydro track from near where the route crosses the river until around 550m, where the track crosses the route described.",
    "description": "There is a car park just west of the River Fyne off the minor horseshoe road that leaves the A83 on either side of the river. Leaving the car park, turn right (ignoring the track ahead to Clachan Power Station), cross the bridge and then turn left. The road is tarmac but private and passes the Fyne Ales brewery and a farmhouse as it heads up the glen. After a little over 3km the road curves to the left and crosses the river on another bridge.\n\nTurn right on the far side of the bridge to continue up the glen. A small cluster of houses are passed at Glenfyne Lodge and, 2km after crossing the bridge, the tarmac road swings right to cross it again en route to a power station. This time stay on the west bank, leaving the tarmac and following a rougher track. The pylons and power station are eventually left behind and the beautiful glen can be enjoyed with less man-made intrusions.\n\nPass through a gate in a deer fence where a sign requests cyclists to head no further up the glen. On the left side of the track are beautiful hazel woodlands, whilst soon the route comes closer to the river and then reaches the old cottage at Inverchorachain, a beautiful spot on a fine day; there is even a glimpse of Ben Lui up the glen. Continue to the gate and there a choice must be made. The route we describe in ascent has a path but is badly eroded in the gorge; one section now involves a tricky scrambling move (which can be avoided via a pathless detour across the steep grassy slopes above) and higher up the going can be very muddy; this route turns left immediately after the gate to head up the south side of the stream. The alternative route - which keeps above the gorge on the north side - is easier underfoot and has a less steep final ascent, but does not have the benefit of a path; we describe this route as the descent. For the gorge route, turn left immediately after the gate to pass through another gate and follow the path which soon comes close the stream, passing some very attractive waterfalls.\n\nThe path is clear but eroded in places and climbs steeply up into a an attractive wooded gorge, mostly keeping well above the burn. There are a couple of slight scrambly steps, the last of which, where the path comes closer to the burn, is very awkward; it can be bypassed by climbing up to the left until the line of crags relents and permits a continuation as a grassy traverse; cut across the steep grass here, ascending slightly further until it is possible to descend back to the path above the difficulty. The gorge is terminated by a waterfall and the clear path climbs steeply well to the left of this, crossing a new hydro track and a stream higher up.\n\nThe ascent now continues more gradually up a boggy mid level; the path across here is wet and faint in places but heads WNW towards the steep and craggy ridge of Beinn Bhuidhe itself. This part of the ascent looks formidable but a path, now clear again though very wet, ascends a grassy initial slope and then continues up a gully with no difficulties to reach the ridge. Suddenly, a fabulous view is revealed down the far side, looking towards Ben Cruachan and Loch Awe. From here a clear path heads to the left along the ridge, keeping very close to the steep left side at first.\n\nContinue up the final cone of the summit, marked by a cairn and very broken trig point. As a viewpoint Beinn Bhuidhe is tremendous, with a stunning view down Loch Fyne and out towards the mountains of Arran, Jura and Mull as well as a vast array of mainland peaks.\n\nReturn along the ridge, but rather than head back down the steep ascent route, continue another 300m along the ridge to reach the lowest point. From here a pathless but straightforward descend can be made by heading east down less steep ground before turning to the southeast as the ridge part of the mountain is left behind. Rather than returning down the gorge, it is easier in this direction to keep above its steepest slopes on the north side. There are a couple of streams to cross which flow down into the head of the gorge but once beyond these the descent is mostly grassy.\n\nWhen a fence is reached cross the stile and head down to a gate at the corner. Go through the gate on the right and follow the fence, then heading through a gate on the left at another corner. Eventually the descent ends at another gate just to the right of some sheep folds, giving access to the track in Glen Fyne. Turn right along this; all that remains is retracing your steps down the long glen back to the start.",

    "description": "There is no public parking for this walk; we describe it from the Drovers Inn at Inverarnan which has a large car park assuming you buy food or drinks after the walk; alternatively you can park at Beinglas Campsite if you use the cafe or shop. Follow the pavement north along the A82 to the turning for Beinglas Farm Campsite, and follow the drive to the campsite which has a shop and a cafe - it may be possible to park here by arrangement. Pass to the right of the cafe, noting the West Highland Way signs and the wooden wigwams. At the back of the site go right and the immediately left onto an unmarked stony and eroded path that climbs steeply uphill into a jungle of vegetation. Higher up it crosses a stile over a fence and continues climbing.\n\nThe Beinglas falls are seen over to the right. Higher up the path crosses another deer fence via a stile and continues, following the the Ben Glas Burn upstream. Eventually this very steep and eroded initial climb relents as more open moorland is reached. Continue following the path by the burn. When it meets an old track coming up from the left, continue ahead, ignoring the track when it swings right to the burn; keep the burn on your right.\n\nEventually the path reaches a hydro track; go straight across this. The rugged outliers of Beinn Chabhair rise up to the left, as the route continues uphill, eventually coming closer to the Ben Glas burn once more. I\n\nImmediately before Lochan Beinn Chabhair the driest route forks left very slightly and then heads to the foot of a wide grassy gully where the path becomes clearer once more. If you miss this, you'll reach the Lochan and can then turn left to the bottom of the gully - across somewhat wetter ground. A clear path then climbs the steeper grassy slope.\n\nHigher up the path bears right and then meanders along the complex ridge, sometimes avoiding and sometimes climbing over rocky knolls and past a couple of tiny lochans. There are good views north west to An Caisteal and Beinn a'Chròin which are sometimes combined with Beinn Chabhair to make a long and strenuous day.\n\nAfter several false summits, the true top is reached at a tiny cairn at 933m. From here there's a superb view over much of the Southern Highlands.\n\nThe easiest route of descent is to return on the same outward path, retracing your steps along the ridge until the bealach after Meall nan Tarmachan and then returning to Beinglas by the same route. As an alternative, you can continue at this point on the ill-defined ridge passing Lochan a Caisteil and descending due West from here until you reach a track where you turn left for a short while to regain the outward route. This is more strenuous and navigation could be difficult; there's no path.",

    "description": "Park at the well-signed car park near the Old Bridge of Tilt. The walk is waymarked with black arrows and begins by leaving the car park via the entrance and turning left along the road. Soon it forks; take the right hand branch which slopes gently uphill, eventually reaching a cross-roads of routes. Head straight across onto a track leading past a bungalow. This track leads into the attractive mixed Banvie woodlands. Keep to the main track up the east side of the burn ignoring the branches down to the left that lead to two bridges. A gate marks the end of the forestry.\n\nThe good track continues, now across empty moorland. It soon climbs away from Glen Banvie, reaching a prominent and well built cairn before ascending again, passing to the right of the hummock of Tom nan Cruach. Follow the track as it winds above the eastern side of the Allt an t-Seaphail and climbs over a low bealach at 514 metres.\n\nThe track then descends slightly and curves right to reach the Allt Sheicheachan bothy, hidden until you are almost upon it. This is an open shelter maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting. The ascent continues by following the track to the left of the bothy, fording the burn and continuing on the now slightly rougher track up its west side.\n\nThe climb contains for some distance until the track swings right and recrosses the burn - leave it before it crosses to take an old stalkers path which continues up the flank of the glen, soon zig-zagging sharply left and gaining height. The path continues clearly, being slightly eroded as it crosses the now open, rolling slopes; one point it forks but the two branches rejoin further on. Eventually it levels onto a flatter shoulder; at a small cairn it makes a 90 degree left turn to head NNW across a very boggy stretch of ground to begin up the broad ridge towards Beinn Dearg.\n\nA minor cairned top is crossed; the true summit of Beinn Dearg is in view not far beyond, across a slight dip. The terrain becomes stony on the final climb; the old path originally passed a little to the left of the summit but these days most people are headed for the large windshelter cairn (with a trig point inside) that marks the Munro of Beinn Dearg at 1008m.\n\nAt the last moment the high Cairngorms join all the other ranges in the extensive views. The whole summit area is covered with rounded granite rocks. The return walk begins the same way - follow the path back to where it left the track by the Allt Scheicheachan. This time follow the track across the burn and uphill briefly on the far side.\n\nThe track climbs up to a junction; here turn right onto the track that contours the slopes, rather than the one that keeps zig-zagging upwards. Follow the track as it heads SSE, eventually running close to the Allt Slanaidh burn. Further on it passes a locked shooting hut.\n\nContinue down the track which eventually enters the forestry by a gate in the deer fence. It now passes above the Glen Tilt rifle range - there are great views from here looking up the glen to the left. Join in with a larger track and continue through the woods high on the west side of the glen. Ignore smaller tracks off to the left (down) and to the right (up) and stay on the main track, passing the steading at Blairuachar. The track becomes a tree-lined lane, with good views over the castellated farmhouse of Bailanloan. It then descends to rejoin the outward route at a cross-roads.

    "description": "There is a car park just north of the house on the east side of the A835 just south of Inverlael Bridge. Start by going back out the car park entrance and then turning sharp right onto a track. Continue along the track towards the hills, with distant views towards Loch Broom to your left. Soon the track leads through a gate and into the Inverlael plantation. Ignore a track that heads off down the left and then one off up to the right. After 2km the track dips to cross a bridge over the river. Further on a track forks off left for Seana Bhràigh, one of the remotest Munros; our route continues up the main track through the forestry.\n\nAfter another kilometre a large turning area is reached, and the route continues on a path. This almost immediately exits the forestry at a gate and the walk now improves greatly as the route follows an old stalkers path up Gleann na Sguaib. Height is gained gradually on the excellent path which keeps well to the left above the burn, with grand views to Beinn Dearg ahead. After another couple of kilometres the path forks; the left path heads up towards Eididh nan Clach Geala and is used on the return, but our route keeps to the main glen path ahead.\n\nThere are impressive cliffs across the glen as Coire Mathair Lathail is reached and a burn is crossed at a confluence. The path now ascends between the two burns to eventually ascend up to Lochan Lathail, a truly beautiful spot. Beyond the lochan the path - which extends far beyond what is shown on some OS maps, despite a couple of indistinct stretches - climbs once more in a series of zig-zags to reach the barren, stony Bealach an Lochain Uaine. There is another series of small lochans here, and the bealach is the junction of several routes.\n\nOur route ascends Beinn Dearg first. To do so, head southeast across the wide bealach to meet a massive stone wall. Turn right alongside this, soon climbing steeply beside the wall and up over some bouldery ground. There are great views back over the bealach. The ascent is strenuous but the slope eventually eases; when you reach a corner where the wall turns right pass through a gap and aim slightly west of south to reach the huge summit cairn.\n\nAt 1084 metres this is the highest Munro north of the A835. The views are superb and very extensive with countless mountains in view; An Teallach is well seen to the northwest, whilst Loch Broom stretches away towards Assynt and Coigach. The photo shows the distant Torridon peaks seen over Loch a' Bhroain. Return to the wall and retrace your steps back down the steep slopes.\n\nThe second Munro to climb is Cona' Mheall. At the end of the wall, pass to the right of a small lochan and then follow a rough path that traverses the southern slopes of a hillock before descending to the east to reach a lower bealach. From here there are magnificent views south into Coire Ghranda with its fine loch. Beyond this bealach the ascent of Cona Mheall is up a wide open slope of grass and scree, with a final boulderfield before the summit, though a faint path helps avoid the worst of the boulders. For many years this was said to have been one of the only Munros with no summit cairn, but there is a small cairn at the 980 metre top today; but no man-made constructions can detract from the wild views across the Coire to the cliffs of Beinn Dearg. Retrace your steps back down to the first bealach and then back to Lochan Uaine.\n\nThis time, ascend the ridge which heads northwest from Lochan Uaine itself, ignoring a stalkers path that heads north. Keep the steep drop on your left and continue up the slope that leads easily to the third Munro of the day, Meall nan Ceapraichean. Continue over the minor bump of Ceann Garbh. The descent from here can be tricky if the best route isn't taken - head east towards a dip before cutting down. There is stony ground and boulders, and several bands of crags; eventually a path can be picked up that descends along the top of one of these lines of crags that slopes down to the next bealach.\n\nThe climb up to Eididh nan Clach Geala is on easier on mostly grassy slopes. There are two cairns - the first is the highest, but the second cairn a short distance beyond is the finest viewpoint. If you are lucky with the weather and light conditions, this fourth and lowest Munro at 928 metres is a great place to enjoy the spectacular view northwest to the mountains of Coigach and Assynt, with Stac Pollaidh prominent.\n\nContinue the walk by descending the west ridge for almost a kilometre before dropping steeply southwards to join up with a stalkers path coming down from Loch a Chnapaich, with great views back to Beinn Dearg and Meall nan Ceapraichean. Follow this stalkers path downhill until it rejoins the outward route in Gleann na Sguaib, then turn right to return to the start by the route of ascent.",

    "summary": "Beinn Dòrain is one of the most instantly recognisable Munros in the southern Highlands, a huge conical peak that dominates the A82 when driving north from Tyndrum. Its ascent can easily be combined with neighbouring Beinn an Dòthaidh which has a fine outlook over Rannoch Moor.",
    "description": "Beinn Dòrain is a peak which has long been admired by passing travellers as it so dominates the route north. It was famously celebrated in the poem Moladh Beinn Dobhrainn (In Praise of Beinn Dòrain) by the eighteenth century Gaelic poet Duncan Ban MacIntyre, who wrote of its 'blooms in agreement, like a great music' - anticipating the modern outlook of ecology. There is a car park close by the hotel in Bridge of Orchy. Begin the walk by crossing the road and following the lane signed for the train station.\n\nFollow the lane to the right (ignoring the level crossing ahead) towards the station, following the West Highland Way. Pass under both sides of the railway line using the underpass. Go through a gate onto a track, and then leave the West Highand Way, crossing the main track and instead taking a stony one to pass to the left of a transmitter mast. The broad path continues uphill, and then forks. Take the right hand branch, which climbs the moorland keeping to the right of the Allt an Dòthaidh. It is a pleasant climb up into the grassy bowl of Coire an Dòthaidh, surrounded by wide slopes dotted with crags.\n\nThe climb out of the corrie involves a steeper section of path. There's then an upper coire before the final climb up to the bealach at 744m. From the bealach the view to the east reveals a glimpse of Loch Lyon in the remotest reaches of Perthshire.\n\nBoth Munros can be tackled from here, and it matters little which you climb first. For Beinn Dòrain, follow the path that clibms southwards, passing over some slabby rocks at first, before gaining a grassier plateau. Continue along the path which twists and turns before climbing up to gain a better defined ridge.\n\nThe path forks at one point - the right hand branch keeps below the ridge and passes to the west of both the summits before cutting back to the top from the far side. It's better to stay on the main, left-hand, path which continues along the ridge a large cairn. In mist many mistake this for the summit, but actually this is Càrn Sasunnaich (the Englishman's Cairn and perhaps a suggestion that Gael's have little respect for the navigational skills of those from the south of the border).\n\nOn the main path, continue from Sasunnaich to the next bealach and then follow the ridge up to the true summit of Beinn Dòrain. At 1076 metres this is a great viewpoint, especially around the southern arc, whilst Loch Lyon is well seen to the northeast. Return along the ridge to the bealach above Coire an Dòthaidh.\n\nThis time follow the path towards Beinn an Dòthaidh. This climbs northeast across the slopes at first to avoid a steep section; beyond it the path continues up very broad and grassy slopes before becoming boggy and somewhat lost around Coire Reidh. Continue across the boggy area to regain a path which climbs up to the bealach between the main summit of Beinn an Dòthaidh and its more distinct southern top.\n\nHead north to reach the true summit of Beinn an Dòthaidh at 1004m. It has a fine view over Rannoch Moor (with Ben Nevis beyond if the day is clear). However, it would be a real shame to come this far and miss the best view on the mountain, which is from the west top just a short walk away.\n\nCross the gentle slopes west to reach the large cairn at around 1000m; the finest view of all is from a small cairn just NW on the edge of the crags, with a magnificent outlook over Loch Tulla, with Stob Ghabhar and its satellite peaks looking magnificent behind. From here you can descend gentle slopes back into Coire Reidh to rejoin the path, and then follow this back down to the bealach. Retrace your steps from earlier in the day to head all the way back to the Bridge of Orchy.",

    "description": "There is a large car park off the A82 road, reached by taking the turning for Dalrigh; keep left and the car park is on the left. Beinn Dubhcraig can be seen from here - the outline of the ridge rising over the trees. The walk begins by continuing along the tarmac lane to cross the West Highland Way and then an old stone bridge - the White Bridge or Drochaid Bhan in Gaelic. On the far side of the river, turn right onto a smaller track. This soon runs close by the railway line (which is on your left). The track then swings left to cross over the railway on a bridge.\n\nOn the far side go through the gate. A path goes off to the right across open ground from here, aiming for the footbridge over the Allt Gleann Auchreoch just above its confluence with the River Cononish. Once across the burn turn left upstream. You are now entering the beautiful pinewood known as Coille Coire-Chuilc, a remnant of the original Caledonian Forest.\n\nThe path continues to be sodden, running a short distance above the river at first before heading southwest, keeping to the north side of the Allt Coire Dubhchraig - a substantial side-stream. Several waterfalls add to the beauty of the setting, despite the wet going. Further on a broken fence is passed through beside a now defunct stile.\n\nThe path continues to be boggy but beautiful, with one particularly fine waterfall over the left. The pines have given way to birches by this point but soon these too are left behind for more open ground (though there are Sitka plantations further right and on the other side of the river); cross over a subsidiary burn at one point. The path becomes much better underfoot and continues beside the Allt Coire Dubhchraig. At one point the stream flows through a series of steep-sided rocky pools, and further on the ascent steepens where the water flows through a small gorge. Higher up the path peters out but continuing in the same direction, the broad ridge is reached.\n\nOnce on the flat back of the ridge a fairly clear path leads southeast for a short and straightforward final climb to Beinn Dubhchraig - with only around 80m of ascent along the broad ridge. There is a superb view south down Loch Lomond, flanked by its Ben and also taking in scores of hills. Return back down the ridge to where you first gained it; the path heads very briefly southwest before continuing to the left of a series of small lochans.\n\nBeyond these the path descends more steeply down rockier ground to reach the Bealach Buidhe, overlooking Loch Oss. Continue on the path to the far side of the bealach. Look out for a tiny cairn that marks the point to leave the clearer path - an old stalkers route across the flank of Ben Oss. Instead follow a fainter path that heads west up a grassy slope at first; soon this path becomes better defined and leads up to the northeastern top of Ben Oss.\n\nA short descent leads to a minor bealach before the final, easier ascent to Ben Oss begins. This follows a better defined ridge heading just west of south, with a good path leading to the summit cairn. At 1029m Ben Oss is a fine and substantial mountain in its own right, but the far more majestic Ben Lui set just to the west completely dominates the view - looking nothing short of magnificent.\n\nReturn over the northeast top and down to the bealach with Beinn Dubhchraig. Do not attempt to descend north from here as the bealach is guarded by crags. Instead it is necessary to reascend eastwards, retracing your steps along the path back up towards Beinn Dubhcraig. Once you are beyond the lochans on the ridge head northeast to reach the point where you first gained the ridge. From here reverse your ascent route from earlier in the day, heading back down beside the Allt Coire Dubhchraig. The path leads back down to reach the birch and pinewoods, backed by views of Ben Challum; continue right back to the start.",

The route described here is from Culra bothy which is closed but you can camp nearby; the setting is beautiful and accessed via a long walk-in from Dalwhinnie.",
    "description": "This route begins from Culra bothy; the walk in from Dalwhinnie to Culra is described separately. Culra bothy is closed due to the presence of asbestos so it is necessary to carry a tent and camp nearby. From Culra a faint path starts up the slope to the west towards Càrn Dearg, soon petering out. Continue up the steep heather slopes to the northwest; the going can be eased slightly by following the line of a grassy gully which is usually dry. When the slope eases, continue across rough ground until curving left to gain the ridge leading up towards Càrn Dearg, which gives much better going.\n\nThe summit of Càrn Dearg has fine views, with Ben Alder and its Leachas ridges having pride of place. Descend west; the ground soon becomes grassy as the route continues across a bealach and crosses the minor Top of An Diollaid. The ridge then descends to a second, lower bealach with some fine scenery.\n\nTo the right Coire Cheap with a circular lochan, whilst on the left the larger Loch an Sgoir is cradled by the spectacular Lancet Edge, whilst the route continues up steep Aisre Ghobhainn, with a path avoiding any problems. It emerges suddenly on a spacious, undulating grassy plateau. In poor conditions it could be difficult to locate the summit, which is marked by a small cairn around a kilometre WSW. From here, it is possible to shorten the walk, either by heading for the Lancet Edge for an exposed scrambly descent, or by heading for the Bealach Dubh.\n\nTo continue the walk to the next two Munros, follow the edge of the plateau WSW; it soon narrows and becomes an obvious ridge as it leads on to a high bealach at 1016 metres. The ascent to dome-like summit of Aonach Beag is short and straightforward; again the summit is marked by a small cairn.\n\nFollow the southwest ridge easily down to the next bealach. The descent route back for Culra leaves from here, but before taking it there is still Beinn Èibhinn to ascent. The first part of this climb is a little steeper, with some rocks, but there are no difficulties. After a slight dip the ridge rises more gently to the first of two summits, marked with the same height on OS 1:25 000 mapping; the second of them is regarded as the Munro, the fourth of the day.\n\nReturn back down the ridge to the last bealach. From here a faint path angles south to avoid some scree to reach grassier ground. Descend into Coire a'Charra Bhig, crossing and then keeping to the left of the stream. Before the bogs at the foot of the corrie are reached traverse the rough slopes to the left, keeping below the crags of Sròn Ruadh but above the peat. Once beyond the bogs drop down to the Allt Coire a'Laobhair and head for the stalkers path a short distance up the far slope. This is superbly maintained; turn left and follow it as it climbs over the Bealach Dubh. From here the path continues for a further 5.5km before reaching Culra bothy once more, crossing the Allt Loch an Sgoir along the way.",

From here walk along the road away from the A85 for a very short distance and turn left over a cattle grid onto a track, near some pine trees. Follow the track, keeping left at a fork. Bear left when the track divides and the way ahead goes through a gate leading to Castles Farm. You are now on the track connected to the Cruachan Dam hydro scheme which has tunnels under Beinn a'Chochuill. Go through a gate and start heading uphill on the track.\n\nThe track climbs on an easy gradient before descending slightly to cross the Allt Lairig lanachan. Soon afterwards at a junction take the track to the right and continue for a short distance until the least steep section of the ridge above is reached. Turn left to climb up the grassy slope in a north-west direction, there is a faint path which becomes clearer as the ridge becomes more defined. The views back over the head of Loch Awe and Kilchurn Castle are worth stopping to admire every now and again. Eventually the main ridge is reached with a good view down to Glen Kinglas on the other side.\n\nFollow the narrow path west along the ridge, climbing past a rocky outcrop before a more gentle section of ridge before the final pull up the grassy slope to the summit of Beinn a'Chochuill at 980 metres. From here retrace your steps along the ridge and at the point where you joined the ridge continue eastwards, along the grassy ridge, towards the bealach Lairig lanachan at 728m.\n\nHere the whole route up Beinn Eunaich can be seen, a straightforward ascent on a grassy and stone slope with a faint path. There are good views down Glen Kinglass, deserted except for the buildings at Glenkinglas Lodge. At 989 metres, Beinn Eunaich is a similar height to the first Munro, however this one has better views back over Beinn a'Chochuill to the Cruachan ridge and beyond, and down to Loch Awe. There is a sizeable cairn on the summit.\n\nBegin the descent by heading directly for the head of Loch Awe, south from the summit cairn. The ridge is grassy and fairly broad. In dry weather the going is good with springy turf underfoot, there is a faint path. Keep following the ridge with good views of Kilchurn Castle ahead. The route crosses a couple of peat hags and shortly after the path bears right to head southwest down very steep ground.\n\nIt may also be possible to continue a little further along the ridge and descend the slightly less steep ground, however there are crags which mean you have to come off the slope before the end and therefore it may be easier to follow the very steep and loose path. The path winds downhill becoming eroded and stony in places until it emerges onto the track below.

Start by walking along the continuation of the road until the turning space at the end, then cross the bridge at Innichro. Keep ahead on the track on the far side before looking out for a signed path which heads off right after 60m. The path is clear to follow, passing through a couple of gates and before continuing up the glen above the Abhainn Chonaig. After a couple of kilometres keep right at a fork (the Falls of Glomach path goes off left here).\n\nThe old path now climbs gently up the glen. As the glen is ascended it takes on an increasingly wild character. For the most part the route keeps well above the river. The Allt a Choire Chaoil can usually be crossed on boulders, though it may be difficult or dangerous in spate. The stalkers path then climbs several zigzags en route as it climbs towards the Bealach an Sgairne.\n\nAbove the zigzags turn right at a cairn (the left path heads for the bealach); the now smaller but still very clear stalkers' path contours round and then descends slightly into the lower reaches of Coire an Sgairne. The scenery in this hidden corrie is impressive, as are the views across to the jagged Sgùrr a Choire Ghairbh over to the right (this ridge can be used in descent).\n\nContinue up the stalkers path which zig-zags up to the upper corrie, and then swings left to climb in zig-zags again and reach the broad Sgùrr an Doire Leathain ridge. Continue up this ridge, leaving the stalkers path (there's a small cairn) and heading up close to the edge of the sweeping plateau.\n\nNavigation could be difficult here in mist. The summit of Beinn Fhada is to the southeast; it is possible to walk round the northern edge of the plateau to reach it, giving fine views of Loch a Bhealaich. A cylindrical trig point marks the summit, a Munro at 1032 metres. The easiest option for the descent is to reverse the route of ascent. The more challening option, which makes for a fine circular walk, is to descend via the Sgùrr a' Choire Ghairbh ridge; this involves a slabby scramble at one point which might be difficult in the wet. This awkward section is easier tackled in this direction however.\n\nIf descending via this alternative route, head west initially across the wide plateau of the Plaide Mhor. The plateau slopes downhill for some distance before ascending to the Top of Meall an Fhuarain Mhòir. From here, a final arete is seen ahead, and a path leads down to the start of it.\n\nThere is a steep descent to the Bealach an t-Sealgaire (Hunter's Pass), but it is the ascent up the far side of this pass which forms has the slightly awkward scramble, up a grassy tongue and then a slabby rock (not very exposed), to reach Sgùrr a Choire Ghairbh. From here, the scrambly and undulating ridge is followed over a series of knobbly summits before a steeper descent is made, heading down towards the minor bump of Bheinn Bhuidhe. From here the ridge continues to curve to the left, before more featureless slopes are descended towards the foot of Gleann Lichd. The route becomes very boggy and ill-defined once down to the glen.

When the path bends right, a signpost indicates a beaten path to start climbing the main ridge of Beinn Fhionnlaidh.\n\nKeep following the definite but boggy path as the route continues uphill, over rough ground with some steep sections. The summit is not visible at this stage although the views down the glen and out to sea improve all the time. It is also a good chance to look at the steep flanks of Beinn Sgulaird directly south across Glen Ure. Eventually the steepness of the ridge gives way to a short level section with a couple of lochans. The path goes to the south side of both lochans and then continues east uphill.\n\nThe ground steepens until the final approach to the summit is reached through a slightly confusing area of smaller tops although the faint path continues all the way. The summit (959m) is not seen until it is nearly reached and it is a small pointy feature with a large cairn and trig point on the far side.\n\nFrom the summit there are good all round views including Loch Etive to the south, steep Sgùrr na h'Ulaidh to the north with a view into Glencoe. It is possible to climb Beinn Fhionnlaidh from Glen Etive but the route is steep and involves a lot of forestry on the lower slopes.

    "description": "There's a car park around 200m east of Chisholm Bridge near the head of Loch Beinn a'Mheadhoin. From here a constructed path heads into the woods, soon joining the hydro track up the east side of the Abhainn Gleann nam Fiadh; turn right up this. At first it passes near a plantation, but wilder country is soon reached with the Munros of Toll Creagach and the more impressive Tom a'Chòinich ahead. The track curves to the left through a scattered pinewood. After passing a hydro dam the route becomes a rough path and is can be very boggy in places, and crosses several streams. The Allt Toll Easa can be impassable in high spate but is usually straightforward. A path goes off right immediately afterwards - stay on the boggy path up the glen instead.\n\nThe cone-like peak of Sròn Garbh further up the glen is the first objective. Continue up the glen for a couple more kilometres until below Coire Mhic Fhearchair. When the path forks, take the higher path to the right which leaves the main stream. It is indistinct where it crosses the Allt Coire Mhic Fhearchair - if you lose the path, you are aiming for the grassy shoulder directly ahead. Further up the path is much clearer as it zig-zags up to the hanging plateau below the Garbh-bealach. Continue up the easy grassy ground all the way to the bealach between Sròn Garbh and An Leth-chreag, where a sudden view of Loch Mullardoch and its own range of Munros comes into view.\n\nTurn left at the bealach for the final steep rocky ascent to Sròn Garbh. There is a loose path to the left but if you follow the crest of the ridge you should be able to ascend an amazing man-made rock-staircase, the remains of an old stalking path. This leads up to the flatter ground at the Top of Sròn Garbh - and a grand ridgewalk now stretches ahead. The ridge is straightforward at first but after Stob Coire Dhomhnuill it is riven into a series of jagged, broken pinnacles. Keen scramblers will attempt to traverse them, but there is a bypass path initially on the right and soon switching across to the left side. Beyond there is a slight ascent to Stob a'Choire Dhomhain before a wide bealach and the final climb up to Càrn Eige.\n\nThis summit, marked by a trig point inside a wind-shelter cairn, is 1183 metres, making it the highest mountain north of the Great Glen. The views are extremely extensive, stretching from Skye in the west to the Moray Firth and Ben Rinnes in the east. At this point a decision must be made whether to include Beinn Fhionnlaidh in the day. This involves the loss of a great deal of height and an eventual reascent but Beinn Fhionnlaidh is very difficult to reach from anywhere else so most Munro-baggers will want to go for it. Descend the northwest ridge, which mostly has a good path.\n\nA stony section of the descent is avoided by keeping to the path near the ridge crest. The path then traverses to the left of Stob Coire Lochan before descending once more to the wide Bealach Beag at 832 metres. From here the path heads directly up the steep grassy slope to the north towards Beinn Fhionnlaidh, with the final section being an enjoyable easy ridge. Beinn Fhionnlaidh is one of the most prized Munro summits due to its remoteness, and has great views both along Loch Mullardoch and looking back to Càrn Eige over the large Coire Lochain.\n\nReturn to the bealach and reascend most of the way back up Càrn Eige. At around 1040 metres there is a flatter shoulder; from here it is possible to traverse across the west side of Càrn Eige to avoid the need to return all the way to the summit. There are traces of a path keeping just below the initial areas of loose stones; continue to contour the slope, rising just slightly and finally crossing a couple of areas of stones before emerging back on the ridge at the bealach between Càrn Eige and Mam Sodhail. If unsure of the ground or the navigation it may be easier to stick with the ridge over Càrn Eige instead. From the bealach a path climbs southwards, finally zig-zagging before reaching the massive cairn on the top of Mam Sodhail. The cairn is hollow but the inside can only be reached by climbing it; it was built by the Ordnance Survey and used as the principal triangulation point for northern Scotland.\n\nAs that suggests, the views are as extensive as those from Càrn Eige. In poor weather, you could escape from the ridges from here by descending the southwest ridge and then following the zig-zag path down the headwall of Coire Leachavie. The upper parts of the corrie are very boggy but further down is a stalkers path that leads to the main Loch Affric path and the long walk out. In good conditions, however, it is more enjoyable to along the long ESE ridge towards Mullach Cadha Rainich. The ridge is narrow but grassy and gives a very enjoyable traverse. There is only a very slight ascent over the Top of Mullach Catha Rainich. Beyond there is a longer but gradual ascent to the terminal peak of Sgùrr na Lapaich along the edge of a curious landslip.\n\nThis summit, not be be confused with the Mullardoch Sgùrr na Lapaich further north, was once a Munro before being demoted to the status of a Top; many walkers feel it deserves Munro status and it could become one again in the future. The views may be less far-reaching than those earlier in the day, but they are more beautiful, with wonderful aerial panoramas over Glen Affric, its forests and lochs. Descend the SE ridge, which is steep and rocky though a path avoids any need for scrambling. Once down to the level of the moors, head east to meet a track at a prominent bend. Head down the track which leads to the shores of Loch Affric below Affric Lodge. Turn left along the main track to reach the car park at the end of the road.

The high mountain you can see on the right is Beinn Ghlas - it must be climbed first and only from its summit will you get your first view of Ben Lawers itself.\n\nContinue on the main path which soon swings right and crosses the stream, then continuing the ascent before finally leaving the fenced area. The peak to the left of Beinn Ghlas is Meall Corranaich, whilst the rockier mountain behind you, back across the car park, is Meall nan Tarmachan. At a fork in the path keep right - the left hand option is used on the return route via the bealach. The path - wonderfully restored by the National Trust for Scotland - soon begins a steeper ascent on ground which becomes increasingly rocky as it climbs with some zig-zags.\n\nThere is a shoulder before a final climb to the small plateau at the summit of Beinn Ghlas - a substantial Munro at 1103m - but many walkers en route to Ben Lawers are unaware of it. From here the view stretches along the fine ridge ahead, culminating in the great bulk of Ben Lawers itself.\n\nFrom Beinn Ghlas the wide path continues along a mostly pleasant grassy ridge, leading down to the bealach (pass) before the ascent to Ben Lawers itself, with a steep section, a more level stretch, and then one final steeper pull - there are great views back over Beinn Ghlas.\n\nThe huge summit cairn that was built in the nineteenth century to try to raise the mountain over four thousand feet has long since gone, and today the summit is marked by a trig point and a view indicator. The views are very fine as well as extensive. Experienced walkers could continue from here over the further Munros of An Stùc, Meall Garbh and Meall Greigh, making a circuit around the fine corrie of Lochan nan Cat. There is trickier terrain (especially on An Stùc) however and this is a very long walk finishing a long way from the car park - transport would need to have been arranged in advance.\n\nOtherwise, retrace your steps back to the bealach. From here there is a bypass path which heads forks right, rounding the north side of Beinn Ghlas to the bealach between it and Meall Corranaich. This path has been improved and gives good going.\n\nIf the time is early and energy is in good supply, more experienced hillwalkers could extend the walk from here by following a steep path off to the right to ascend Meall Corranaich, there joining the usual circuit of Meall Corranaich and Meall a' Choire Lèith. For everyone else, the main path continues down across the flank of Beinn Ghlas to rejoin the route of ascent. When you reached the fenced area, the National Trust for Scotland request that you do not descend on the Nature Trail route, which is reserved for ascent only to reduce erosion, so remain on the main path.",

    "description": "There is a car park in Glen Lochay some distance short of Kenknock - it is no longer possible to park at the end of the public road. Head on foot to this point where there is a cross-roads of routes; turn right up the private tarmac road that heads through a gate and leads up to the pass over to Glen Lyon. Follow this road up a series of zigzags - with good views down Glen Lochay - until NN461369 where a good Hydro track leaves it to the left.\n\nThis soon crosses a small bridge and then over a pipeline running down the hillside. It then contours the slopes heading west up Glen Lochay towards the hills. The mountain that steals the show up the glen is Ben Challum, looking a fine peak from this unfamilar side. Continue along this track, passing through several gates and crossing the bridges over the Allt Badour and later the Allt Batavaim. After the latter it descends a little and reaches a junction where a track comes up from the floor of the glen. Keep right here, continuing along the hydro track until it heads through a gate in a deer fence.\n\nOnce through the gate leave the track and turn right, following the fenceline uphill; continue by the fence when it turns right. Continue to reach a stile in the upper deer fence. Now on open ground, the craggy slopes of Sròn nan Eun rise above. Climb diagonally north to pass the first broken crags, then aim WNW up grassy slopes below the higher upper crags. Soon a wide grassy brake in the cliffs enables you to ascend steeply northwards until above the steep ground. Now continue up easier slopes - soon accompanied by a faint path - onto the ridge of Sròn nan Eun. Now the upper cone of Creag Mhòr comes into view at last, still some distance away.\n\nContinue along the ridge, crossing two small depressions. The path becomes better defined and the ground steeps on the final ascent of the rockier upper slopes. Eventually the large summit cairn is at 1048m is reached - a satisfying viewpoint with mountains in all directions.\n\nThere are impassable crags blocking the direct route to the bealach dividing Creag Mhòr from Beinn Heasgarnich, so instead it is necessary to descend the easier ground to the west and then northwest along the initial section of ridge leading towards Meall Tionaill before heading back ENE to the bealach once easier slopes are reached. Cross the peat bog here before beginning the ascent up the steep grassy slopes to Sròn Tairbh.\n\nContinue up along the ridge to the top of Stob an Fhir-Bhoga. From here a very broad grassy ridge leads across the wide ridge towards Beinn Heasgarnich itself. There are stunning views looking back to Creag Mhòr and Beinn Challum.\n\nEventually the cairn marking the summit of Beinn Heasgarnich is reached. This is superb viewpoint, but the bad news is that the descent is tricky and tedious, with broken crags and vast areas of peat bog to negotiate. Aim east down broken slopes, passing just north of a small lochan, heading down into Coire Ban Mòr .\n\nThere are many steep burns carving ravines down this slope, and its best to get to the south side of them. After the flatter middle ground there's a steeper descent again to gain the level of the Moine Achlarich - a massive peat bog. The north bank of the Allt Tarsuinn has the driest ground and can be followed - but if in spate, you need to make sure you get to the south side of both it and another adjacent burn before they become uncrossable.\n\nAim for the summit of the private Glen Lochay - Glen Lyon road - the solid tarmac will be reached with much relief! Turn right to follow the road which leads back down into Glen Lochay and to the start of the walk.",

The direct ascent of Beinn Narnain as described here is very rough and rocky, with some slight scrambling - a tougher start than many ascents in the Southern Highlands. Beinn Ìme - the highest of the range - is much smoother from this direction - a long steady grind from the bealach.",
    "description": "Start from the car park (charge) at Succoth on the north side of Loch Long near Arrochar. From here cross the main road and follow the marked path opposite through the woods - the main route to the Cobbler. Only a few paces along it however - well before the first bend - our route leaves this obvious walkway for a muddy side path through the undergrowth - it's unmarked and easily missed. The path soon becomes clearer and starts to climb steeply; it is often very wet after rain. The climb is accompanied by a series of overgrown concrete squares - the remains of the hydro project here. When a track is reached, go straight across it and continue on the rugged path over a rocky step - as much waterfall as path if wet! Soon the path improves and there are good views back down to the loch and Ben Lomond beyond.\n\nHigher up, a path heads off left which traverses the hill - linking with the Cobbler path near a weir; it's quite wet. Instead keep straight ahead uphill, There are a couple of easy rocky scrambles and a boggy area where the path is faint on this next section. After the next steep section of ascent, the Cobbler can be seen to the left. There is a brief flatter section before the continuing ascent to Cruach nam Miseag.\n\nFrom here the route descends briefly before tackling the rocky slopes beyond on the left side at first, eventually climbing to reach the foot of the prominent rock buttress of the Spearhead. Pass to the right of the main buttress and ascend a the rock-filled gully beyond - no difficulties but take care.\n\nThe final section to the summit is across easier ground, with a clear path to the stone-built trig point. There are good views to the Cobbler, Beinn Ìme and the wider hills beyond; perhaps the best view is looking down Loch Long to the Firth of Clyde.\n\nFrom the summit continue west north west across the stony plateau, descending some boulders at one point before a clearer path is joined that leads down to the Bealach a' Mhaim. The original route headed directly down towards Beinn Ìme, but it's quite eroded and it's probably better to stick to the well-made path that reaches the bealach between Beinn Narnain and the Cobbler. Turn right here.\n\nAlthough a steep and rocky mountain from most viewpoints, this side of Beinn Ìme is largely a broad and grassy slope, though there is a well-made path. The ascent is a long grind, with almost four hundred metres to gain from the bealach. It ends at the trig point at 1011m - the highest summit in the Arrochar Alps; the view is a fine reward.\n\nReturn back the same way to the bealach, then continue ahead for the descent part, ignoring the Cobbler which is up the steep path on the right. Continuing the descent, the path has been vastly improved in recent years and is dry and easy going underfoot. Follow the route downhill, ignoring the junction to the right part way down where another path descends from the Cobbler. There are great views of its strange rock architecture from here. Two giant blocks of rock known as the Narnain boulders are passed; some of the early working class Glasgow climbers used to sleep here during the exploration of the Cobbler's cliffs.\n\nThe path now runs alongside the Allt a' Bhalachain, crossing side streams on large stepping stones at times. Shortly after passing the small hydro dam on the right, there is a junction with a faint path that traverses the slope to the left. Continue straight on, on the main path which starts to descend through the trees. When the path reaches a track near a mast transmitter, turn left and then right at a bench to follow a zig zag path down through an area of felled trees heading towards the Loch. Eventually the path emerges back on the main road opposite the car park.",

    "summary": "The long approach up Glen Ey deters many from the round of these two remote Munros. On a busy weekend they give a quieter escape from the busier hills of the area.",
    "description": "There is a small car park in Inverey. This remote community was the last place in eastern Scotland where Gaelic was spoken, in the 1930s; it is split by the Ey burn; the east side (Meikle Inverey) was Protestant whilst the west (Little Inverey) was Catholic. Begin the walk along the track from Meikle Inverey which heads southwest, soon passing a grand house and then through a gate to approach the Ey burn. After a kilometre both the burn and the track fork; take the left branch, which soon crosses the Ey and then zigzags uphill before continuing up the right hand side of the glen.\n\nDown to the left by the burn is an overhanging rock and gorge (now partly collapsed); this sheltered the Colonel's Bed. In the 17th Century a colonel, outlawed for the murder of a Laird, made this his refuge, and was brought food each day by his lover; it requires only a short detour but take care as the rock edges are loose and slippery. Further on are the scant ruins of Auchelie, an abandoned farm. The track then runs closer to the burn once more; on the far side can be seen the Piper's Wood, which has been fenced as an experiment in regeneration.\n\nBeyond, the track crosses the burn once more on another bridge, before crossing back after another two and a half kilometres; there is a view of Beinn Iutharn Mhòr ahead. The track ends at Altanour Lodge, the sad, roofless ruin of and old shooting lodge, still sheltered amongst its trees and with beautiful grassy pastures. If using a mountain bike, this is the best place to leave it. Continue by churned-up tyre tracks up the glen for another four hundred metres, keeping right at a fork.\n\nA maze of muddy tracks and paths leads on up the glen, eventually crossing the Alltan Odhar and then climbing the ill-defined ridge between it and the Allt nan Clach Geala; at the flattening there are a series of grouse butts. Continue NW and then eventually N, leaving the wet ground beyond for the final short pull to reach the cairn on the stony top of Càrn Bhac, a rather shapeless Munro but offering a grandstand view of the southern Cairngorms.\n\nFollow the ridge towards to the 920m top (marked as Càrn an Rìgh on 1:50k maps) before breaking off and descending southwards down wet ground. Extensive peat hags have to be crossed on the 789m bealach; beyond this a slight rise leads to a second descent to a lower bealach. Beyond this the ground increasingly steepens towards the very steep flank of Beinn Iutharn Mhor. Most of this slope is covered with loose scree; in summer there are traces of a path towards the left side.\n\nThe northeastern end of the summit ridge will be reached with some relief. Turn right and follow the graceful curve of the pebbly ridge as it swings left and then right round to the large cairn marking the true summit of Beinn Iutharn Mhòr at 1045 metres\n\nFollow the ridge back northeast and then continue down it as it curves back to the east. Further down there is a steep section before the bleak lower moorland is reached once more. The going now becomes rough once more; either keep to the height of the land or follow very rough paths above the W side of the Allt Beinn Iutharn.\n\nThere is a bridge over the Alltan Odhar, not marked on OS maps, before Altanour Lodge is again reached. From here Return back down the long miles of the track (you could have brought a mountain bike here!) to return to Inverey.",

    "description": "Strong walkers can combine Beinn Liath Mhòr with Sgòrr Ruadh to give a grand circuit; the route for this is described at the end. If arriving by car, park at the layby on the A890 opposite the telephone box and the private road to Achnashellach station. From here walk up the road to the station, turning right after the outbuildings. Cross the railway line with care and proceed up the track a short way until you reach a crossroads. Here turn left slightly back on yourself and continue on a forestry track, passing through a gate and into thinning trees. Ahead there is a good view of the prow of Fuar Tholl, a fine Corbett which just misses out on Munro status.\n\nAfter a short distance take a path to the left marked with a post. If you miss the path and continue on the track into thicker trees turn back as the way ahead is blocked by a fence higher up. The path heads towards the River Làir, passing through a gate, and then through a mixture of gorse, broom, birch and single pine trees. The path begins to climb revealing fine views and passing the Achnashellach Estate deer stalking information sign.\n\nFollow the stony path as it winds uphill, ignoring a smaller path to the left. The ground becomes much barer as the path climbs above the last of the pines. After the gradient eases off, a path junction marked with a cairn is reached. There is a good view Sgòrr Ruadh and its majestic sandstone cliffs on the left side of the valley ahead, and further left the even mightier cliffs of Fuar Tholl are seen in full stature, whilst the long scree-flanked ridge of Beinn Liath Mhòr guards the right side of the valley.\n\nTake the right fork. Further on a second, larger, cairn is reached on the right - keep right again. The path on the left leads into Coire Làir and can be used on the descent. Continue the climb towards the head of the pass, the Drochaid Coire Làir, but before reaching it the path forks once again. Take the left fork this time, which crosses rough rising ground before beginning a very steep and somewhat eroded climb up to gain the ridge. Eventually the slope eases for a final rise over stones to reach the easternmost summit of the ridge, marked by a large cairn at 876 metres. There's a superb view northwards towards Beinn Eighe, with the quartzite glittering white on sunny days.\n\nBegin the walk along the ridge, soon dropping to a narrow bealach with a couple of rocky blocks. The ridge then rises again before a climb up to reach the 887m summit at the centre of the ridge. The going is almost universally stony - and the quartz sections can be slippery when wet.\n\nContinue west again to a second col; there is some slight scrambling on the descent at one point. There's another area of quartz to cross after the next bealach before the ascent becomes grassier on the climb towards the final section of the ridge.\n\nThis narrows to a fine arête of quartzite stones, with the true summit of Beinn Liath Mhor, at 926m, reached at the far end. The massive summit cairn has great views across Coire Làir, and of Liathach and Beinn Eighe to the north.\n\nFrom the summit, continue down the ridge to reach a flattish shoulder. The path becomes unclear on this section, the route crossing some sandstone slabs before arriving atop a steep crag that looks down into a narrow bealach holding a lochan. You need to find the path to descend this, initially with slight scrambling down a rocky gully before the slope eases and the path descends left. Beyond here a faint path crosses the left side of the rocky knoll, marked with cairns in some places, before a final descent to the main bealach which has another small lochan; this whole descent route is very rough and it can be hard to find the best route, especially in mist.\n\nThis bealach is crossed by the stalkers path up from Coire Làir. It is possible to extend the outing onto Sgòrr Ruadh. Otherwise, to return to the start, turn left down this path which keeps on the northern side of the valley, descending until it rejoins the outward route at a cairn. From the cairn, turn right and then left at a second cairn to return to the outward path down to the woods above Achnashellach. To reach Sgòrr Ruadh from the lochan on the bealach, climb up the slope opposite to reach a very small lochan on the ridge of Sgòrr Ruadh. Turn left here, climbing the scree-covered ridge up to reach the summit. From there, follow the route described on our Sgòrr Ruadh walk to return to Achnashellach.",

    "description": "Park in the small parking area just north of Torrandhu bridge on the A835. There is a Met Office weather station here. Rather than head up beside the boggy burn, a signpost instead points to a start which leads briefly east along the road. Cross the bridge and then take a right turn onto a track into the forestry. After 2.5km turn right downhill, emerging from the trees and crossing a bridge over Abhainn an Torrain Dubh. On the far side the track continues as a rough ATV track, which is boggy and intermittent in places. It does, however, assist with the ascent up towards Creag Dubh Fannaich.\n\nWhen the ATV track swings left at around 560m leave it and continue on a faint path. This peters out; continue to reach the minor summit of Creag Dhubh Fannaich, marked by a small cairn; the view extends back over Loch Glascarnoch, whilst the final two Munros on today's route look impressive above lochan-filled corries. Continue across a broad bealach and begin the ascent of Beinn Liath Mhòr Fannaich itself up a mixture of grass and boulders. The cairn on the summit, the first Munro of the day at 953 metres, is towards the western end of the small plateau, by some rocky outcrops. A good view opens out westwards over Loch a'Mhadaidh, with the prominent dome-like summit of Sgùrr Mòr towering to its left.\n\nThe intervening bealach can very difficult to locate in misty conditions, with intervening steep, stony and very loose terrain. It's probably best to descend just slightly north of west from the summit for a short distance, soon over steep stony and loose ground, to meet a stalkers path that cuts across the west side of the mountain. Turn left along this, which cuts through the steep ground and zig-zags down to the bealach. The stalkers path continues up the far side of the bealach and passes to the left of a minor peak before the ridge narrows briefly. As the ridge broadens again, the stalkers path contours round to the left; leave the path here and climb more directly up the steep slopes towards Sgùrr Mòr - again with big drops on the right.\n\nThe slope eases shortly before the impressively built summit cairn on the summit of Sgùrr Mòr is reached. At 1110 metres, this second Munro is the highest summit for miles around, and its impressive 'witches hat' outline marking it out in distant views from other mountains across the region. The view, as might be expected, is very extensive, with Sgùrr nan Clach Geala looking very impressive close at hand, and An Teallach commanding to the northwest.\n\nDescend back down the south ridge, briefly retracing steps before continuing down a slope eroded into a series of terraces made by a process known as solufluction during the last ice-age. From the bealach continue up over the minor summit of Meall nan Peithirean with its flat rocks. There are excellent views to the north all along this ridge down into a series of rocky, lochan-filled corries. The path descends gently down the far side of this top to reach a bealach, and after passing to the right of the bump of Creachan Rairigidh reaches a second bealach. Here the path forks, with a branch to the south descending towards Loch Fannich; our route follows the path which climbs up to the summit of Meall Gorm. This flat-topped Munro is the third of the walk, and has a height of 949 metres.\n\nThe ridge continues east, passing a curious and partly collapsed stone shelter presumably built by stalkers. Continue to a final top at 922m before descending steeper stony ground to reach the wide Bealach Ban. From the bealach, continue up the very wide grass and scree-covered slopes to the summit plateau - it is possible to avoid the scree by taking a traverse to the right part way up the slope - once beyond the scree ascent grassy slopes direct to the summit.\n\nThe summit of the fourth Munro, An Coileachan, is marked by a well-built cairn atop a sandstone outcrop. There's a great view looking along to the termination of the ridge at An Eigin, backed by Loch Luichart, as well as looking back over the whole range and Loch Fannich.\n\nHead north across the plateau before picking your way steeply down a stonier section - any difficulties can be avoided to the left side - heading in the direction of Loch Gorm. Once on flatter ground follow a more defined path to the bealach southwest of Meallan Buidhe. The route on from here becomes very boggy and very rough, though with a path of sorts at first. Contour the west side of Meallan Buidhe and aim a little east of north across the moors - the path fades out - to reach the Abhainn a'Ghuibhais Li at a bridge. Cross and then follow the far bank of the burn downstream to the second bridge used on the ascent. Cross this to retrace your steps via the forest track - with some unwelcome ascent - back to the car park.",

The walk begins along the track heading north from here, with great views ahead of Beinn Dòrain. Soon the West Highland Way joins in from the right. Continue ahead along it until the track reaches a cross-roads. The West Highland Way continues ahead over a bridge here; but to continue for Beinn Mhanach don't cross, instead turn right alongside the Allt Kinglas.\n\nThe track crosses a bridge over the stream coming down from Glen Coralan on the right before passing beneath the railway viaduct and entering Gleann Ach-innis Chalein, more commonly known as the Auch Glen. When the track forks, keep to the left branch close by the river. The track soon fords the river, crossing to the north side. This can sometimes be done with dry feet but when in spate could be quite impossible. Continue on the far side until the track recrosses the river at a second ford around 1.3 kilometres further on (continuing on the near side would be possible but rough and boggy).\n\nThe track now crosses several shallower bends in the river before crossing back to the north side again at NN350386. This time it stays on the north side for only a short distance before crossing back, and there is a path remaining on the south side. Finally after the river forks the Allt a 'Chùirn branch is forded to reach the farm buildings at Ais an t-Sìdhean. The great Gaelic poet Duncan Ban MacIntyre lived here in the eighteenth century; he celebrated the beauty of Beinn Dòrain on the left in his most famous poem.\n\nThe track fords the river again before crossing it a final time at - a bridge made of sleepers! Just beyond it forks; take the right hand branch which heads up the glen to the east. After around a kilometre the track crosses a bridge over the Allt a'Chùirn which here descends steeply from the hillside on the left, with a series of waterworks which extract water for the hydro-schemes of Perthshire. Cross the bridge and then leave the track, heading straight up the hillside to the left, keeping to the right of the stream. A fence also runs up the hillside a little to the right - this leads to the bealach between Beinn a'Chùirn and Beinn Mhanach.\n\nThe easiest going is by crossing the fence part way up to aim directly for the latter summit. The ascent is unrelenting but the going is grassy and mostly firm. The summit of Beinn Mhanach is a Munro at 953 metres. There are higher peaks all around restricting the view, with Beinn a'Chreachain to the north looking the most impressive; a short detour further along the ridge brings most of Loch Lyon into view. The easiest and quickest descent is to retrace the outward route. There is a reasonable alternative which crosses wetter and slightly rougher ground. This descends to the bealach with Beinn a'Chùirn (a Top, which can be visited by a short detour from this point though its other slopes should be avoided). Here the fence will be rejoined, and can be followed across the boggy hillsides towards the lower bealach of Lon na Cailliche at NN354417.\n\nHead down the glen of the Allt an Loin from here. A track will soon be picked up that crosses the stream twice before forking. Keep left here before re-crossing the stream beneath a small concrete dam. The track then descents to rejoin the outward route at NN357395. From here retrace your steps down the glen, eventually passing back under the viaduct to return to the start.",

There is a path down this coire, and at the far end it begins to descend very steeply and rockily - take care - on the east bank of a cascading stream towards Loch Avon, with great crags and Beinn Mheadhoin visible across the loch.\n\nLower down look out for a path leading off on the far side of the stream - cross here and follow the path which makes a descending traverse heading towards the head of the loch. The Loch Avon basin is one of Britain's wildest and most awe-inspiring places. It can only be reached by either a climb over one of the surrounding mountains, or a truly epic walk for miles down the remote Glen Avon. At its head is a circle of great cliffs that forms the finest climbing ground in the Cairngorms.\n\nContinue to the top of the loch beneath these cliffs, where there are several stunning beaches. This point can be reached by an alternative route from Coire Cas, via Coire an t-Sneachda and the 'Goat Track', and then a descent of Coire Domhain. The 'Goat Track' is however often banked out by snow into summer, and even then is unpleasantly loose with the danger of rockfall from above, but this route does avoid the ski-developments.\n\nFrom the beach at the head of the loch, take a narrow path that heads towards the huge vertical block of Shelter Stone crag. It soon crosses the stream flowing into Loch Avon; this crossing can be difficult or even impassable when in spate. Beyond it the path begins to climb once more for some distance towards the crag, before weaving back left towards the Allt nan Stacan Dubha. It is possible to make a short detour further right from the bend to visit the Shelter Stone - a truly enormous fallen boulder, marked by a cairn on the top.\n\nKnown in Gaelic as Clach Dion, the boulder is held up by many smaller stones to create a hollow underneath that can accommodate about five people. The resulting cave has been used as a refuge for centuries. The floor is flat enough for sleeping although many find that having a 1360 ton balanced rock immediately above their noses just a little claustrophobic; others prefer to camp. Return to the path to continue the ascent, steeply for a time. As path path comes closer to the stream the gradient eases off and crosses some wetter ground. It continues to ascend gently, and Loch Etchachan comes into view over to the right - a suprisingly large sheet of water at over 900 metres. Before the path begins to descend, turn off left making an initially pathless ascent.\n\nEventually a path from the Loch Etchachan outflow is joined and the plateau of Beinn Meadhoin is reached. Continue along it to the first of the series of tors - known as the Barns - which distinguish Beinn Mheadhoin. This low one overlooks Loch Avon and gives a good view of the larger ones to follow on the walk to the summit, across sandy terrain, almost desert or tundra-like, , blasted by the winds.\n\nIn thick mist the larger tors can help with navigation as you take a bearing from one to the next to make progress towards the top, and even in clear weather most walkers will detour to visit them. The summit of the mountain, at a mighty 1182 metres, is atop the largest tor towards the northeastern end - a truly massive block of granite. To reach the true top a short, reasonably easy scramble is necessary, accessed via the far side of the tor.\n\nMuch hard work remains to return to the car park, as the glacial trough of Loch Avon must be crossed once more. You can either return by the exact same route, descend to the foot of Loch Avon and up to the Saddle before heading back over Cairngorm, or perhaps even extend the day further by heading to the outflow of Loch Etchachan and return via Ben Macdui. Whichever route is chosen a substantial ascent cannot be avoided.",

    "description": "Catch a train to Corrour Station. The remotest stop on the UK rail network, it isn't accessible by road. The large building here - once a hostel - is now a cafe / restaurant. Begin the walk along the vehicle track across the moor to the east. When the track forks follow it round to the left. The tiny Loch Ossian Youth Hostel is visible on the near shore of the loch.\n\nAfter 250m the track swings right, then after a similar distance it crosses a small bridge. Turn left after this, then as the track swings left leave it and follow a faint boggy path that heads directly for the west ridge of Beinn na Lap. After a gentle start it begins climbing straight up the moorland ahead, with good views looking back over Loch Ossian.\n\nThe slope eases into the broad ridge of Ceann Caol Beinn na Lap. Head up this towards the summit; there are some rocky undulations along the way. Before reaching the summit there is square windshelter cairn on the right hand edge of the ridge overlooking Loch Ossian.\n\nFinally the true summit cairn is reached - the high level start minimised the effort involved in getting here and it can be hard to believe this is really a Munro. Nonetheless the views do not disappoint as Beinn na Lap gives a fine perspective on the arc of higher summits around as well as a more open sweep towards Rannoch Moor.\n\nThe usual return is back the same way - perhaps leaving time for the Corbett Leum Uilleam if you had an early start. Another option for a longer walk would be to follow the Sròn na Cloiche Sgoilite ridge and then follow the path and track back through Strath Ossian and along the north shore of Loch Ossian.",

    "description": "The walk starts along the track leading down to Coiletir from the Glen Etive road; there is a good sized parking layby off the opposite side of the road. Head down this track and over the bridge over the picturesque River Etive. Beyond this a junction is reached - keep right here and follow the hydro track. At Coiletir a sign indicates a path round the cottage to the left, but it's much easier walking to stay on the hydro track that bypasses it to the right. Eventually the track reaches the Allt Mheuran.\n\nContinue to the bridge, then turn left onto a boggy path on the far side, following the burn uphill; avoid the scar on the right left from the tempoary hydro track. When the path forks take the higher route - the lower path closer to the burn cuts across an eroded slope above a steep gorge further on whilst the older, higher route steers clear. A fairly faint path soon heads off right heading directly for Ben Starav; ignore this and continue on the broader path up the glen.\n\nIt is very boggy underfoot in places but the views, both ahead -with the Eas Mheirlich or Robber's Waterfall prominent over to the left - and looking back across Glen Etive, are a fine reward. The path soon comes closer to the Allt nam Meirleach and crosses a tributary coming down from Coire an Fhir-leith; beyond the Meirlich flows through a succession of box canyons and some care is needed in places (on the return it is natural to take a higher path which is further from the rim). The head of the glen climbs very steeply to the Bealach Lochain Ghaineamhaich but the path winds a clear route up to this pass.\n\nYou are now at the low point of the ridge between Ben Starav (right) and Glas Bheinn Mhòr (to the left). For Beinn nan Aighenan it is necessary to lose around 150m of height; two small paths head diagonally left down the far side of the bealach. Take the lower of these (the upper one peters out in a boulder field) and continue down and across the slopes to the southeast. Beinn nan Aighenan looks close at hand at first before the full drop down to the bealach is revealed. The path is small but makes its way down the rocky, slabby slopes to reach the low point.\n\nThe path continues by heading up the ridge to Beinn nan Aighenan. Again the climb is rocky and fairly steep in places but there are no great difficulties. As height is gained good views open up towards Loch Etive to the right - with Ben Cruachan prominent - and out towards Loch Tulla to the left. The slope becomes more gradual before the summit cairn is reached. Now the long walk back begins by heading back down the ridge to the bealach.\n\nTo return to Glen Etive, it is necessary to climb 150m back over the Bealachan Lochain Ghaineamhaich. From here you could extend the walk along the ridge to either of the other Munros; otherwise return the way you came back down the Allt nam Mheirleach.",

    "description": "Start from the car park (charge) at Succoth on the north side of Loch Long near Arrochar. From here cross the main road and follow the marked path opposite through the woods - the main route to the Cobbler. Only a few paces along it however - well before the first bend - our route leaves this obvious walkway for a muddy side path through the undergrowth - it's unmarked and easily missed. The path soon becomes clearer and starts to climb steeply; it is often very wet after rain. The climb is accompanied by a series of overgrown concrete squares - the remains of the hydro project here. When a track is reached, go straight across it and continue on the rugged path over a rocky step - as much waterfall as path if wet! Soon the path improves and there are good views back down to the loch and Ben Lomond beyond.\n\nHigher up, a path heads off left which traverses the hill - linking with the Cobbler path near a weir; it's quite wet. Instead keep straight ahead uphill, There are a couple of easy rocky scrambles and a boggy area where the path is faint on this next section. After the next steep section of ascent, the Cobbler can be seen to the left. There is a brief flatter section before the continuing ascent to Cruach nam Miseag.\n\nFrom here the route descends briefly before tackling the rocky slopes beyond on the left side at first, eventually climbing to reach the foot of the prominent rock buttress of the Spearhead. Pass to the right of the main buttress and ascend a the rock-filled gully beyond - no difficulties but take care.\n\nThe final section to the summit is across easier ground, with a clear path to the stone-built trig point. There are good views to the Cobbler, Beinn Ìme and the wider hills beyond; perhaps the best view is looking down Loch Long to the Firth of Clyde.\n\nFrom the summit continue west north west across the stony plateau, descending some boulders at one point before a clearer path is joined that leads down to the Bealach a' Mhaim. The original route headed directly down towards Beinn Ìme, but it's quite eroded and it's probably better to stick to the well-made path that reaches the bealach between Beinn Narnain and the Cobbler. Turn right here.\n\nAlthough a steep and rocky mountain from most viewpoints, this side of Beinn Ìme is largely a broad and grassy slope, though there is a well-made path. The ascent is a long grind, with almost four hundred metres to gain from the bealach. It ends at the trig point at 1011m - the highest summit in the Arrochar Alps; the view is a fine reward.\n\nReturn back the same way to the bealach, then continue ahead for the descent part, ignoring the Cobbler which is up the steep path on the right. Continuing the descent, the path has been vastly improved in recent years and is dry and easy going underfoot. Follow the route downhill, ignoring the junction to the right part way down where another path descends from the Cobbler. There are great views of its strange rock architecture from here. Two giant blocks of rock known as the Narnain boulders are passed; some of the early working class Glasgow climbers used to sleep here during the exploration of the Cobbler's cliffs.\n\nThe path now runs alongside the Allt a' Bhalachain, crossing side streams on large stepping stones at times. Shortly after passing the small hydro dam on the right, there is a junction with a faint path that traverses the slope to the left. Continue straight on, on the main path which starts to descend through the trees. When the path reaches a track near a mast transmitter, turn left and then right at a bench to follow a zig zag path down through an area of felled trees heading towards the Loch. Eventually the path emerges back on the main road opposite the car park.",

    "description": "The walk begins at Arnisdale village, a beautiful and extremely peaceful and remote spot. Please do not park on the verges; a couple of small car parks have been provided, one just a hundred metres from where a footpath sign (near the west end of the village) which reads 'Ben Sgritheall' indicating the start of the walk.\n\nThe ascent begins with a climb up behind the village on boggy ground; higher up the way crosses the main burn and steepens considerably. It requires a sustained effort to continue the ascent steeply right up to the bealach.\n\nFrom the bealach the slopes leading up to the 906 metre top have to be tackled more or less direct, and are even steeper than the climb thus far. There are long fingers of grass which enable avoidance of most of the scree; it is still something of a turf-clutching crawl however. The 906 metre top at the start of the ridge will be reached with profound relief. From here, follow the ridge across a wide col towards the summit of the mountain; on the final rise the ridge becomes narrow and airy. The views over Knoydart and Barrisdale Bay are superb, as is the vista north and northeast-wards over range after range of Kintail peaks.\n\nThe summit of Beinn Sgritheall has a triangulation pillar at 974 metres, and on a clear day has one of the most magnificent panoramas you'll ever see, the view of Loch Hourn now being matched by a fabulous outlook over Skye and the Cuillin ridge. If the weather permits, you'll want to linger here, before beginning the descent down the west ridge of the mountain. This is rocky but not too difficult, and has a couple of easier sections to relieve the general steepness. Continue along the ridge to the small lochan at NG816126.\n\nFrom the lochan, the descent turns left and begins to head down towards the road. The ground is as steep as ever, but it should be possible to find a narrow path which winds a little awkwardly down the slope and through the Coille Mhialairigh forest. At length it reaches the road, and never were you so glad to step foot back onto level tarmac. Turn left along the road to return to Arnisdale in about three kilometres.",

    "description": "There is limited parking in a layby on the minor road just east of Druimnavuic. The walk begins just a few metres to the west of here, where two tracks leave the road; the right hand one heads to the gardens, so take the larger bulldozed left-hand track through a gate. It soon climbs up through the trees. Pass through a second gate and continue on the track as it soon leaves the trees behind. Already there are good views back over Loch Creran, and across it to the oakwoods of Glasdrum Nature Reserve; ignore a faint track off to the right and keep on the main one which makes a wide zig-zag to the left and then back to the right to climb the hillside. A small cairn marks the point at which to leave the track and take a grassy path heading up the ridge on the left.\n\nThe small path climbs steadily up the grassy slopes whilst the views back improve further with each step. As point 488 metres is reached, progress along the ridge is barred by a cliff dropping to the bealach. Follow the path as it heads to the left above this cliff; it leads to a gap where the path zig-zags easily back down to the bealach. The ridge is crossed by a post and wire fence; climb this to continue uphill, slightly to the right of the ridge line at first, making a long and steady climb up straightforward slopes. The sharp summits of Ben Cruachan come into view through over a pass to the right, whilst behind the view now takes in the whole of Loch Creran, with the Isle of Lismore in Loch Linnhe beyond. If the day is clear the mountains of Morvern and of Mull, including Ben More, are well seen.\n\nAs the 863 metre summit is reached there is a great view of Loch Etive, now making the foreground to Ben Cruachan. The summit of Beinn Sgulaird is now also in view, looking very fine with Ben Nevis to the left and the peaks around Glen Etive to the right. It doesn't look far from here, but this belies the terrain which is much harder going from this point. The descent to the next bealach, after a brief flattish section, is down over boulders and scree, though a path descends slightly on the right of the ridge line and makes the going easier.\n\nCross the bealach and then begin the ascent of the next summit, the dome of Meall Garbh. Meall Garbh has much outcropping rock and curving slabs; the path is faint but there are no real difficulties. It has its own summit cairn, giving a superb view of the main peak of Beinn Sgulaird beyond, with great sweeps of rock slabs on its left flank. The descent to the next bealach is again steep and rocky, requiring care.\n\nThe final ascent now begins up the south ridge of Beinn Sgulaird. This is better defined and gives an enjoyable climb; near the top the ridge becomes rockier and the path traverses slightly to the left before a little very mild scrambling leads up to the small summit plateau. The Munro summit, at 937 metres high, is marked by a large cairn. On a clear day, the views in all directions are sensational; inland are the great mountain ranges around Ben Nevis and Glencoe, whilst Cruachan above Loch Etive looks magnificent. The steep slopes give great depth to the views downwards, but best of all is the view along Loch Creran out to the sea and the islands.\n\nThe ridge continues to the northeast to several lower summits but the slopes above Glen Ure are forbiddingly steep. One possible alternative return is to descend WNW from the summit down a steep, ill-defined ridge and then continue westwards when easier ground is reached, but this route too is unrelentingly steep. The best way back is to return the way you came, enjoying the superb views ahead which are well worth the small extra effort of crossing the two lower summits. Once Point 863 metres is reached once more the descent is very pleasant. From the final bealach below the crag at 488 metres, it is possible to avoid the reascent by heading downhill to the left to gain the track. Turn right down the track to return to the start.",

    "description": "The walk is described from Shenavall bothy; this can be reached via a walk-in from Corrie Hallie as described on the Shenavall route. The bothy is maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting. An alternative is to wild-camp; there is a great spot in the alder woods at NH088788; this is best reached by following the track used as the way back on the Shenavall circuit.\n\nFrom Shenavall Beinn a' Chlaidheimh rises extremely steeply across Strath na Sealga; although it is possible to make a direct assault many walkers will prefer to head up the strath and then approach it from the east, so start along the path which leads ESE. It becomes a track near the ruined house at Achneigie. Continue for another 1.5km - the alder woodland over to the right makes a great spot for a wild camp - until the track begins to climb to the left (bound for Corrie Hallie); instead follow a fainter, grassy track which heads west at this point and leads alongside the Abhainn Loch an Nid. This river must be waded - as with two river crossings at the end of the walk, this is not possible if the level is high.\n\nOn the far side, head directly up the slopes of Beinn Chlaidheimh. After wet but steep heather initially the slope eases to a more gradual grind until the much fiercer upper slopes are reached around 500m. Pass just left of the crags that guard the nose of the main ridge, making your way up steep heather as soon as practical to reach the ridge above at a flattish shoulder. There is then a brief climb up easy scree to gain the narrow summit ridge at point 900m. Follow this airy but grassy ridge across a slight dip to reach the summit cairn, with great views down the very steep west face into the strath, as well as back over the pinnacles of An Teallach. The descent begins almost immediately, with a path down the scree slope to a first bealach at 787m. Continue over a broad and bumpy section of ridge before a second descent leads down to a lower bealach at 650m, marked by a couple of lochans.\n\nContinue south up rough quartzite boulders to gain the very broad NE ridge of Sgùrr Ban. The ridge is littered with rough boulders all the way up the long pull to the top; there is grassier ground further right but this leads onto steeper terrain higher up. The summit cairn is in the centre of a small plateau but the walk continues in the same direction, heading down fairly straightforward slopes to reach the bealach at Cab Coire nan Clach. The next Munro, Mullach Coire Mhic Fhearchair, rises in intimidatingly steep slopes. However, there is an eroded path which leads up scree for the steepest part of the climb, and in good weather it can easily be picked out on the descent from Sgùrr Ban. The slope then eases and continues - still over stones and boulders - to the summit, the highest of the Fisherfield 6.\n\nThe descent is less steep, leading SW and then S, but even more covered with quartzite boulders which make it more time consuming. From the bealach beyond, the steep 851m peak of Meall Garbh appears to be a formidable obstacle, but a bypass path avoids this by cutting across its very steep NW slope to reach a second, lower bealach. From here the slopes of Beinn Tarsuinn are broad and mostly grassy, hiding the drama of the other side of this mountain, which is revealed only as the summit cairn is reached. Follow the narrow ridge to the left to soon reach a square tilted platform which sits astride the mountain and has been likened to a tennis court. A path scrambles easily up onto the 'Tennis Court' to reach a cairn at the far end before descending once more. The next section of ridge is riven into a series of pinnacles, but the walk continues by taking a clear bypass path which runs around the left side.\n\nContinue along the bypass path until a clear path forks off left very steeply down the loose slope. This leads to the extensive and very boggy bealach between Beinn Tarsuinn and A' Mhaighdean - the lowest point of the walk at 525m. The pull up to A' Mhaighdean from here is a very long grind up a broad, grassy slope - a real effort for tired legs. The lure is what is regarded as the remotest of all Munros - and perhaps the finest Munro summit view. The highest point is right on the edge of an abyss as the slopes to the west plunge for 800m down dramatic crags to the Dubh Loch, with Fionn Loch and the sea beyond and amazing rock architecture all around. The view south down to Gorm Loch Mòr and the crags of Beinn Lair is scarcely less impressive, and summiting A' Mhaighdean must be ranked amongst the highlights of a round by any Munroist.\n\nHead towards the more dome-like northern top before descending steep but largely grassy slopes and then rocky ground to reach the Poll Eadar dha Stac, the pass at the foot of Ruadh Stac Mòr . There is a very rough stone bivouac shelter here, which may be of use in an emergency. The last Munro of the round, Ruadh Stac Mòr , rises directly above and the route to it appears to be barred by a band of crags, whilst a stalkers path cuts off to the left to descend past Fuar Loch Mòr . A small cairn, however, marks the point to strike up the well-worn scree slope to reach the foot of the cliffs. The route through the crags above can be picked out during the descent from A' Mhaighdean; it heads up an eroded gully above the scree slope. Getting into the gully requires a straightforward scramble, best started slightly along a ledge to the right from the top of the scree path. From here a big scrambling step up leads onto a wide, well-worn stony gangway that slopes to the left and then continues up the gully before emerging on the boulderfields of the upper slopes.\n\nA faint path winds up the boulders and passes through a gap in the summit crags to reach the cairn. This is another superlative viewpoint in the very heart of the wilderness, surrounded by dramatic rock peaks and glistening lochans; to the north are the Lochan a'Bhragdad backed by the perfect cone of Beinn Dearg Bheag and the pinnacled ridges of Beinn Dearg Mòr beyond. Head along the NNW ridge - negotiating yet more boulderfields - for around 250m before aiming directly between the two lochans to the NE. The slope is terraced with several steeper sections unseen from above. Pass between the lochans and continue north, following a burn down into the hanging valley below. Cross the burn and aim diagonally up the slope opposite to pick up an excellent stalkers path above the Clach na Frithealaidh - a prominent rock.\n\nFollow the path to the right. It angles down towards Loch Beinn Dearg before swinging back to lead easily down Gleann na Muice Beag, eventually leading down to a path running along the Abhainn Ghleann na Muice, a substantial river. Continue down this path to reach the chalet and cottage amidst the group of trees at Larachantivore. Wade the river near here - again, this is impossible in spate. The direct route back to Shenavall now crosses a severe bog, with great care needed to avoid stepping into one of many waist-deep, slime-filled pools, before reaching the second river, the Abhainn Strath na Sealga, just short of the bothy. Alternatively you could continue by the riverbank to the junction of the two rivers. Either way, the second river too needs to be waded before heading back to Shenavall.",

To start, follow the track up into the plantation, (there is also an overgrown and soggy but waymarked trod upstream beside the river but this is not recommended). The track soon bends left and later to the right (where there is another option to follow a path off to join the route by the river). Beyond this the track reaches a junction. Turn left here and continue to eventually reach the forest edge, where the riverside 'path' rejoins.\n\nContinue through the first soggy field to a gate and stile, and then bear right through another gate to reach the open slopes. Begin the long, wet pull up these largely pathless slopes towards Meall Clachaig. This is an area of rocky knolls, rather than a well-defined top. There's a deer fence across the hillside which is crossed at a stile. Beyond it the ascent continues, now on drier ground. There are stunning views looking back to Loch Treig and to the hill ranges across the glen, with the Grey Corries looking particularly fine.\n\nContinue up the fairly featureless mountainside until the southern top of Beinn a'Chaorainn is finally reached, marked by a cairn.

There have been several accidents to walkers in winter taking a bearing between these two summits and falling through the cornice into the corrie, so in such conditions be careful to keep safely away from the edge, both on this stretch and that to the north top.\n\nContinue this fine traverse, curving round another perfect arc to reach the northern summit at 1043 metres, and a final look back across the corries.\n\nFrom here, begin the descent northwards at first before slanting down increasingly wet ground towards Tom Mòr , at the bealach between Beinn a'Chaorainn and Beinn Teallach. The height lost is very considerable, but there is some encouragement in that Beinn Teallach is a much lower hill.\n\nRound the steep lower slope of Beinn Teallach to the right before beginning a direct climb up the north-northeast ridge. There is a faint path for most of the way; the upper section of the ridge has many rocky knolls and outcrops. There are two cairns on the summit; the first is reckoned to be highest but the second is finer.\n\nBeinn Teallach is now known to be 915 metres but was for many years regarded as below 3000 feet, until in 1984 it changed from being one of the highest Corbetts; it is now the lowest of the Munros. Descend the easy southern slopes before curving round to the left to reach the Allt a'Chaorainn lower down. A deer fence is crossed at a gate.\n\nThe stream can be quite tricky to cross, so may be best to try to reach the east bank as high up as possible; in wet conditions you may need to detour north up the glen to find an easy crossing. Once on the far side, a faint and soggy path leads down the glen to eventually return to the forest track and then retrace your steps back to the start of the walk.",

The slopes to and from the ridge are steep, rugged and pathless.",
    "description": "Park in the car park at the end of the public road beyond Loch Voil, where the varied scenery of the Trossachs begins to give way to a more mountainous, Highland landscape. Continue along the track on the north side of the glen to the farm at Inverlochlarig, with Beinn Tulaichean in view ahead. Inverlochlarig was the site of the final home of the celebrated outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor following his pardon; he died here in 1736 and his grave can still be visited in Balquhidder churchyard. Follow the track as it swings left and crosses the bridge over the burn.\n\nOnce over the bridge cross the stile on the right and follow the path up by the burn, passing a small hydro building and then joining the track heading north up Glen Inverlochlarig. Turn right along this, continuing until clear of the farm area and passing through a gate in a fence. There is no path up the slopes of Beinn Tulaichean; it's probably worth continuing along the track until a bend before following an ill-defined bumpy ridge to avoid some of the boggy ground at its base. From here climb to the left of a large cairn on a grassy knobble, and then continue up the slopes.\n\nAt around 500m a fence line runs across the slope - passing through a gate in this at NN426 188. Continue uphill, avoiding any broken crags; the slope eases briefly at around 700m. The ridge of the mountain becomes more defined ahead and a path helps on the final climb, which keeps left before swinging NNW to gain the ridge line. There are superb views looking back over Loch Doine and Loch Voil.\n\nA final stroll along a grassy ridge leads to the cairn atop a small rocky outcrop on the summit. The views are extensive to the southeast but rather curtailed by higher mountains in other directions, though Cruach Àrdrain and the high peaks of Ben More and Stob Binnein appear impressive. Follow the path along the ridge towards Cruach Àrdrain, descending easily to the bealach between the peaks.\n\nContinue across the bealach on the path that heads up towards Cruach Àrdrain itself. High on the ridge a small cairn marks where a path coming up from the Grey Height ridge joins in.\n\nEventually the path swings right along the summit ridge, but there's a short sharp descent and reascent before the true summit of Cruach Àrdrain is reached. The view sweeps down Coire Àrdrain to Crianlarich, and takes in a wide array of the mountain peaks of the Southern Highlands.\n\nRetrace your steps back to the bealach with Beinn Tulaichean. From here a small cairn marks the start of a path that heads down the initially grassy slopes to the east.\n\nSoon the path fades out and the descent continues down open slopes. It is rough going at times and there are some slabby rocks and broken crags to avoid on the way down.\n\nOnce down to the floor of the glen a grassy track is reached. Turn right to follow this south back towards Inverlochlarig Farm, looking out for a sign that indicates where to leave the track on the left to avoid the farmyard and retrace the outward route back to the start of the walk.",

Follow the old road from the layby through a gate and then to the left parallel to the A9. After a short distance along the tarmac, fork right onto a track which slopes down to pass beneath the railway through a small tunnel. On the far side head right along a track, fording a small burn, and then keeping left to begin the walk up into Coire Dhomhain.\n\nThe steep dome-shaped hill on your left is the Sow of Atholl (a Corbett); unless including this in the day, continue along the track for 2km. Here is the first of two bridges over the main burn; there is a choice of routes to Sgàirneach Mhòr - our route crosses here, but it is possible to continue to a second bridge and initially follow a track up past some grouse butts. For our route, cross the first bridge, follow the first track around a bend to the left and then leave it for the start of a boggy path through the heather that aims up and across the slopes aiming for the bealach west of point 758m.\n\nCross the grassy gully below the bealach and continue the ascent towards Sgàirneach Mhor; as height is gained the ridge becomes well-defined with the broken crags of Coire Creagach on the right. At the apex above this corrie is the trig point marking the summit at 991 metres; the first Munro of the day. There is a first glimpse of Ben Alder but this view improves as the walk continues.\n\nThe descent begins very gently over perfect mossy turf. Head southwest at first, then northwest towards a bump before cutting down to the bealach at the head of Coire Dhomhain.\n\nFrom the bealach a path heads uphill beside a burn at first before curving to continue up the south ridge of Beinn Udlamain. The going becomes stonier and the walk generally follows a line of old metal fence posts (many of which are missing so not a completely reliable guide). There are magnificent views looking back of Ben Alder beyond Loch Ericht.\n\nCcontinue uphill, passing an old collapsed shelter, to eventually reach the huge cairn on the summit - at 1010 metres the highest of the Drumochter Munros.\n\nContinue northeast from the summit to a minor bump where the ridge then descends more steeply to the east. It is possible to continue the walk onto A' Mharconaich; otherwise continue almost to the 860m bealach before striking off steeply downhill over awkward heather. The descent is a bit of a trial - aim for the bottom of the stream flowing down from the bealach between Beinn Udlamain and A'Mharconaich - but keep well right of the stream as it has carved a ravine.\n\nThe floor of Coire Dhomhain will be reached with some relief.

Approaches are long from any direction; Corrour Station gives the nearest access from the west, whilst it is possible to approach from Loch Rannoch in the south. The finest approach, however, is from Culra bothy (closed but you can camp nearby) to the northeast, accessed via a long walk-in or cycle from Dalwhinnie.",
    "description": "This route begins from Culra bothy; the walk in from Dalwhinnie to Culra is described separately. Culra bothy is closed due to the presence of asbestos so it is necessary to carry a tent and camp nearby. From Culra Ben Alder looks magnificent, with two rocky ridges - the Short and Long Leachas, enclosing a hanging corrie. This route follows the ridge on the right - the Long Leachas and gives some very simple scrambling. Start in the opposite direction, following the track back downstream for just over 300 metres to reach and cross the bridge over the Allt a'Chaoil-reidhe. On the far side follow the grassy path to meet the superbly maintained stalkers' path, and turn right up this to begin the walk towards Ben Alder. After almost 2 kilometres the path bends left away from the river and climbs up the moorland towards Beinn Bheòil. Look out for a small cairn at NN515744 which marks a convenient place to leave the path and strike out across the heather.\n\nA faint path runs across the slope and eases the going at first. Drop slightly to cross the Allt a'Bhealaich Bheithe, which can be done on stones when the water is low but may be difficult in spate. Continue across the rough moor beyond, aiming to reach the Long Leachas just to the left of a slight hummock on the ridge. Once on the ridge there is path. The ridge can appear intimidating, but the path winds up the first very steep rise, weaving between crags with no real difficulties. The ridge then levels off before a second steep rise that looks to be barred near the top by crags.\n\nAt this point the path heads to the right before climbing back up to the ridge crest via a scrabbly gully. Beyond the ridge is narrow and rocky but any real difficulties can be easily avoided before the route emerges suddenly on the stony plateau beyond. Continue across this, keeping the crags to the left and climbing up past the top of the Short Leachas ridge. The going now becomes a little grassier and there are good views down to Loch a' Bhealaich Bheithe to Beinn Bheòil, before finally a rougher pull over boulders leads up to the summit of Ben Alder, marked by a trig point in a windshelter cairn with a much larger cairn alongside. The stone ruin just north below the summit is all that remains of a camp set up by Major General Thomas Fredrick Colby as part of the original Ordnance Survey mapping party.\n\nContinue round the plateau edge (careful navigation needed in mist), which bends to the left shortly after passing Lochan a'Garbh Choire; there are great views over the Garbh Choire. After passing spot height 1103m (OS 1:25k map, or marked with a 1100m contour ring on OS 1:50k) leave the cliffs and head to head southeast. From NN502705 descend down steep, rough slopes by a burn to reach the Bealach Breabag, with good views of Loch Ericht and Rannoch Moor beyond. It is important not to follow the edge of the plateau as it curves further east and then north as this leads out onto a prow from where cliffs bar any descent to the bealach.\n\nFrom the bealach it is possible to cut the walk short by heading north and following a stalkers path back to Culra. To include Beinn Bheòil in the walk, however, follow a faint path up the slopes of Sròn Coire na h-Iolaire. It is possible to bypass this summit of this Top on the left before following a narrowing ridge down to a bealach and then on up past a rocky knobble before reaching the cairn marking the summit of Beinn Bheòil.\n\nFrom the summit there are excellent views both back to Ben Alder and along the length of Loch Ericht, with a glimpse of distant Dalwhinnie. Continue along the ridge for another 750 metres or so before bearing left down the slope once past the screes. Continue WNW down the moor, aiming to meet the stalkers path close to where it changes direction. Once gained the path gives excellent walking back to the bridge over the river and Culra bothy.",

    "description": "There is a car park for walkers at Keiloch on the Invercauld Estate a short distance off the A93; a charge is made. Begin the walk along the tarmac lane signed as a public footpath to the Linn of Quoich. Continue along this road, passing the attractive estate houses. If the weather is clear, there are fine views of Beinn a' Bhùird ahead, but Ben Avon itself is initially out of sight.\n\nThe track soon passes through some pinewoods and above the back of the grand castellated mansion of Invercauld House. Ignore the waymarked paths which go off to the right. Continue along the lane until a fork before Alltdourie, keeping right here before taking the next left beyond (signs for Slugain). It then runs through forestry until reaching a signposted fork; main left branch goes across the river and leads to the Linn of Quoich; instead keep ahead, again signed for Slugain. The route soon leaves the trees and runs along the edge of the forestry beside the stream, before the plantations are left behind altogether and the track continues up the bleak central section of the glen.\n\nA couple of kilometres the glen narrows beyond and is clothed with some birchwoods. The route soon forks; you can either take a higher route that keeps to the north side of the upper glen, or you can cross the stream and instead follow a more attractive path up the glen floor. This section is known locally as the 'Fairy Glen' and is a delightfully hidden fold in the hills. It is also famous in the hillwalking world as being the location of the 'secret howff' - a tiny and well-hidden bothy whose whereabouts has been kept a closely guarded secret - so you'll have to find it for yourself! The path passes the roofless ruins of Slugain lodge before the higher route joins back in from the right.\n\nThe path now climbs gently to the pass at the head of the glen to overlook the upper reaches of Glen Quoich. Stay on the main route that keeps across the slopes well above the stream. The well-made path continues almost to the head of the glen, crossing the Glas Allt Mòr . After crossing this stream the route zig-zags to the left before heading sharply right to reach the prominent boulder of Clach a'Cleirich.\n\nA smaller path continues beside the Glas Allt Mòr ; continue the ascent to the bealach at the very head of the glen. Known as the Sneck, this bealach at over 970 metres is the high level link between Ben Avon and neighbouring Beinn a'Bhùird, enabling both to be climbed the same day by the very fit; there is a small hummock in the centre of the bealach that almost makes it a double pass. The view north into the wild Slochd Mòr is dramatic, particularly looking to the left into the great climbers' corrie of the Garbh Coire. Turn right at the Sneck and continue the ascent to soon reach the vast plateau of Ben Avon, with wonderful views back towards Beinn a'Bhùird.\n\nFinding the summit on this high-level plain could be difficult if the mist is down, but in clear conditions it is easy as the huge tor of Leabaidh an Dàimh Bhuidhe marks the true summit of Ben Avon. This is a short distance to the northeast across a shallow depression. Reaching the topmost rock is easy enough if the weather is calm but does require the use of the hands; the easiest route is through the dip in the centre of the tor before scrambling up at an easy angle.\n\nThe return walk is usually made the same way. The fittest might ascend Beinn a'Bhùird after returning to the Sneck; unless the river is in spate it is then possible to descend the west side of Càrn Fiaclach and ford the burn to regain the outward route.",

If full, it is no longer possible to park at the Power Station Visitor Centre, but there is a proper layby about 700m further along the road towards Oban, on the right hand side. From the Railway Station sign walk up the path and then under the railway line via an underpass. Climb the concrete steps up the other side that lead to the left of an electric substation. Look out for a path heading off left through the trees. Continue on this path as it meanders through the oak, birch and hazel wood, climbing steeply in places. The Allt Cruachan can be heard flowing down the little gorge on the left. There are occasional views out over Loch Awe.\n\nAfter the trees thin out, the path leads over a stile at a deer fence and then continues uphill, soon emerging at a surfaced track. Turn left and cross a bridge over the stream and continue up the track to reach the Cruachan dam, which is very imposing at close quarters.\n\nHere turn left up the zig zag path and then climb the metal staircase onto the dam itself. Turn left to cross the rest of the dam and immediately take the path on the right to short cut to the track heading round the west side of the reservoir. Follow the track along the side of the reservoir until you reach the end. Before the end of the track a small cairn marks a path heading up to the left. However this path is the boggier of the two and it is better to continue over the stream and then climb immediately left on the second, clearer path.\n\nThe path climbs up the glen, becoming steep and eroded to reach the upper level of Coire Dearg. From here it levels briefly before another short and steep pull up an eroded stony path to the bealach, where there is a small lochan. From the bealach follow the eroded stony path to the right which climbs towards the summit of Cruachan. The path soon becomes lost as the arduous climb continues up stones and boulders.\n\nThe summit is marked by a cairn and the stump of a former trig point. At 1,126 metres this is the highest peak for miles around, and the views are fantastic, particularly down over Loch Etive, and out to the west to the prominent pointed summit of Taynuilt Peak (a 'Top' of Ben Cruachan) and the sea and islands beyond. But most attention, perhaps, will be looking along the grand rocky ridge stretching ahead.\n\nHead along the fine ridge which is rocky in places; looking back the summit peak of Cruachan looks very impressive. After the first dip, the route crosses a series of easy rock slabs before climbing back to the crest via a gully (they can be bypassed to the right, but this loses some height). The ridge then continues, rocky in places, with good views in all directions.\n\nA steeper climb leads almost to the summit of Drochaid Ghlas. The highest point lies just off the main ridgeline to the north but a short detour can be made to the top. Otherwise turn right just before the top of Drochaid Ghlas at a cairn to make a loose and steep descent on a clear path. From here on the ridge is a pleasant walk with a steep pull up to the summit of Stob Dàimh, with great views back to the peaked summit of Ben Cruachan. At the Stob Dàimh cairn - the second munro of the day - the clear horseshoe route from the Dalmally side can be seen.\n\nHead south from here along a clear ridge, crossing a bealach before the slight climb to Stob Garbh. After this the route descends gradually towards the bealach at the Lairig Torran. The route now becomes pathless for a time; aim WSW, keeping to the right of a burn and heading down the grassy slopes.\n\nFurther down a clearer path is picked up. Follow this; eventually it crosses the burn and traverses boggy ground above the reservoir to meet a track at the end of a tunnel carrying water through the mountain. Follow the track uphill slightly and then down, passing the dam; keep left. Continue down to the point where the road forks; turn right here and follow the track briefly until the outward route heads off to the left. Rejoin this and retrace your steps back down the rugged path to and through the woods to return to the railway station and the start of the walk.",

The path weaves a route to avoid any crags - but there are great views up Strathmore as recompense for the effort.\n\nThe path emerges on a grassy shelf that soon slopes up to gain the very broad southern ridge of Ben Hope. This slopes gently at first before a steepening is reached. The path makes a wide zig-zag to the right to ascend this section, before aiming back towards the escarpment once more.\n\nBack close to the steep western escarpment, the path continues more clearly as an eroded route up the grassy slopes, soon ascending a steeper section to reach a false summit.\n\nAfter another respite the route steepens once more to reach the small summit plateau. The summit trig point - and a windshelter cairn - stands amid a mass of boulders a short distance across this, and is a truly wonderful viewpoint.\n\nThe plateau ends abruptly, with the extremely steep and airy north ridge plummeting beyond with great walls of crags on each flank.

Above this the ascent begins to steepen, and higher on Cnoc Sgriodain the ground becomes much drier underfoot.\n\nContinue climbing ENE to reach a large cairn; the path fades out once on the drier plateau area.\n\nContinue along the ridge, passing another cairn and then descending to the next broad and peaty bealach, where the going becomes very boggy once more and the path reappears.\n\nPeat hags make a less welcome appearance. The path continues up towards Creag an Lochain, but before reaching the summit it swings left to make a traverses across its western flanks. Note that this route is not likely to be suitable in winter when it would usually be better to follow the ridge.\n\nPass the bealach marked as point 688m on the Ordnance Survey map. Continue along the ridge of A'Chioch to reach the foot of the summit pyramid. Here the path turns east and heads up a rocky band before continuing up the grassy slopes above.\n\nThe final ascent is steep, with a couple of stony sections, but no real obstacles on the way up to Meall nan Con, the highest point of Ben Klibreck. At the top is both a summit cairn and the remains of two broken trig points. The views in all directions are of the vast empty spaces and moors of the far North - perfect desolation.\n\nThe best return is to retrace the outward route. For a little variation, you could visit the summit of Creag an Lochain overlooking Loch an Fhuarain.",

Its great height is undermined by a high level car park to begin the ascent, and this is one of the most popular hills in Scotland. A second Munro - Beinn Ghlas - is crossed en-route and is barely noticed by many.",
    "description": "Start at the Ben Lawers car park on the west side of the road (parking charge). The area is designated as a National Nature Reserve and is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. Begin the walk by heading through the walled intepretation area and on the surfaced path to a gate. Go through this and cross the road to continue on the path, with views to Beinn Ghlas ahead. Soon the path passes through a gate into an area fenced to protect the flora from overgrazing by sheep and deer; the difference in vegetation on each side of the fence is obvious.\n\nThe nature trail goes off to the right here (and can be included in the ascent); otherwise remain on the main path which keeps to the left of the stream at first, climbing gently amidst the birch trees. The high mountain you can see on the right is Beinn Ghlas - it must be climbed first and only from its summit will you get your first view of Ben Lawers itself.\n\nContinue on the main path which soon swings right and crosses the stream, then continuing the ascent before finally leaving the fenced area. The peak to the left of Beinn Ghlas is Meall Corranaich, whilst the rockier mountain behind you, back across the car park, is Meall nan Tarmachan. At a fork in the path keep right - the left hand option is used on the return route via the bealach. The path - wonderfully restored by the National Trust for Scotland - soon begins a steeper ascent on ground which becomes increasingly rocky as it climbs with some zig-zags.\n\nThere is a shoulder before a final climb to the small plateau at the summit of Beinn Ghlas - a substantial Munro at 1103m - but many walkers en route to Ben Lawers are unaware of it. From here the view stretches along the fine ridge ahead, culminating in the great bulk of Ben Lawers itself.\n\nFrom Beinn Ghlas the wide path continues along a mostly pleasant grassy ridge, leading down to the bealach (pass) before the ascent to Ben Lawers itself, with a steep section, a more level stretch, and then one final steeper pull - there are great views back over Beinn Ghlas.\n\nThe huge summit cairn that was built in the nineteenth century to try to raise the mountain over four thousand feet has long since gone, and today the summit is marked by a trig point and a view indicator. The views are very fine as well as extensive. Experienced walkers could continue from here over the further Munros of An Stùc, Meall Garbh and Meall Greigh, making a circuit around the fine corrie of Lochan nan Cat. There is trickier terrain (especially on An Stùc) however and this is a very long walk finishing a long way from the car park - transport would need to have been arranged in advance.\n\nOtherwise, retrace your steps back to the bealach. From here there is a bypass path which heads forks right, rounding the north side of Beinn Ghlas to the bealach between it and Meall Corranaich. This path has been improved and gives good going.\n\nIf the time is early and energy is in good supply, more experienced hillwalkers could extend the walk from here by following a steep path off to the right to ascend Meall Corranaich, there joining the usual circuit of Meall Corranaich and Meall a' Choire Lèith. For everyone else, the main path continues down across the flank of Beinn Ghlas to rejoin the route of ascent. When you reached the fenced area, the National Trust for Scotland request that you do not descend on the Nature Trail route, which is reserved for ascent only to reduce erosion, so remain on the main path.",

The path up is well made, but the optional return down the Ptarmigan ridge is steep and rocky, and muddy lower down.",
    "description": "Start from the car park (charge) at Rowardennan. The mountain is not in view from the car park but can be seen from the metal jetty on the loch shore. The ascent starts by heading through the information building (which has seasonal toilets). The excellent path climbs steadily through oak woods.\n\nSoon the path reaches a track - go straight across and continue on path opposite. Cross a small bridge and soon there are the first views of part of Loch Lomond. The native forests are being regenerated here, after the removal of commercial plantations. Further up the route passes through a gate. The path becomes rockier in places.\n\nPass through another gate to reach the open hill. By the 1990s this section of the path had been eroded until it formed a scar up to 25 metres wide, visible from Glasgow. The National Trust then began a program of repairs and the current, excellent path is only a couple of metres wide. The ascent continues; the views back over Loch Lomond and its islands are already stunning.\n\nThe gradient eases slightly as the shoulder of the mountain is gained. The final summit cone of Ben Lomond is now in full view ahead and the path heads directly towards it.\n\nThe ascent steepens once more in two great zig-zags up the final cone of the mountain. The view back over the islands in Loch Lomond becomes ever more impressive, and at the second switchback there is a first great view east over the Trossachs, with Loch Chon and Loch Àrd visible.\n\nThe path eventually reaches the rim of the very impressive eastern corrie which has been hidden until this point - a sudden moment of real mountain drama. The path keeps to the left of the cliff edge before making a final short rise to the summit.\n\nFrom the summit trig point there are stunning views in all directions, particularly of the southern end of Loch Lomond and its islands. It is rare to be alone at the top, as this is one of Scotland's favourite mountains, popular with visitors and locals including fell runners who make numerous ascents in a year. The easiest and most usual route back is to retrace your outward route, but there is a rougher alternative.\n\nFor the alternative, harder descent, take the rocky path NW, soon descending a very steep rocky slope. The route leads to a col before climbing south-west to Ptarmigan at 731m. From here the route follows the nobbly ridge for much of the descent with excellent views down Loch Lomond. Approximately half way down the ridge, the distinctive shape of the Cobbler comes into view alongside the other peaks of the Arrochar Alps on the far side of the Loch to the west. There is a clear path although it is narrow and rocky in places. The wettest areas have been improved with large stepping stones. About two-thirds of the way down the path leaves the true ridge to descend below crags and continue on a direct route towards Rowardennan.\n\nThe path passes through a gate and descends more steeply. Before reaching some trees at the top of the woodland bear left to go through another gate and descend alongside the burn. After an open gateway there is a good view of a waterfall. Continue down through the woods until the road is reached. Turn left here and walk along the road passing behind the Youth Hostel. For the last section it is possible to take the path to the right along the shore. This passes a modern war memorial sculpture by Doug Cocker of Dundee. Ben Lomond and its slopes going down to the loch have been dedicated as a Memorial Park to commemorate those who have lost their lives for their country. From the memorial continue round the shore a short distance to return to the car park.",

The shortest route to it is from Glen Lochy, enabling easy inclusion of its less impressive neighbour Beinn a'Chlèibh.",
    "description": "Park in the car park (charge) off to the left of the A85 at NN239278. A good path leaves this and heads for the river Lochy. The path goes to the right along the bank of the river - head along it, looking for the most convenient place to cross. The Lochy is a wide river but usually shallow enough to wade; it can be crossed easily in very dry conditions, whilst in spate any crossing would be very dangerous or even impossible. On the far side is the railway - crossing over the lines here is a criminal offence. Instead use the low bridge through which the Eas Dàimh flows under the line to join the Lochy - here a metal grid provides access for walkers that should keep your feet dry in most conditions (again, impassable in spate); you will need to stoop!\n\nThe path continues through a felled area and then through the trees alongside the burn. After 500m a confluence of burns is reached - ensure you cross the Eas Dàimh here and instead follow the burn from the Fionn Choire beyond - both burns have paths alongside. Soon after this, in another felled area, cross the Fionn Choire burn to reach and pass through a gate in a deer fence. From just beyond this a rough track leads uphill through cleared forest until you reach a main forest track at around 300m. Turn left along this until reaching a bridge over the Fionn Choire; immediately after this turn right onto a path that again heads up steeply through the trees. Some sections are very boggy.\n\nThe path thankfully leaves the forestry at a metal gate at around 490 metres in Fionn Choire. From here you could make directly for the bealach between the two peaks, but it gives more variety to leave that route for the descent. Instead climb directly to the east - a featureless, initially soggy, pathless and unremitting but mostly grassy ascent that leads eventually to the north ridge of Ben Lui. There are great views looking back over Glen Lochy.\n\nFrom here the climb becomes much more enjoyable; turn right up the still steep ridge, rocky in places, which becomes increasingly well defined. There is a cairn marking the northwest summit, and walkers coming up from the ridge enclosing Coire Gaothach join the route here.\n\nThe higher southeastern summit is a short distance further across a dip. At 1130m Ben Lui is one of the highest and probably the finest Munro in the southern Highlands. The cairn has a magnificent situation right on the edge of the great Coire Gaothach which usually holds snow into early summer and has a classic winter climb known as Central Gully - for mountaineers.\n\nFrom here the neighbouring Munro of Beinn a'Chlèibh looks quite insignificant. To begin the descend down the broad ridge towards it, retrace your steps off the summit to find the top of a path. This leads down a long, broad slope to reach the bealach.\n\nFrom the bealach the zig-zags its way up the ridge beyond to reach the spacious plateau; the summit is marked by a cairn at 916m. Beinn a'Cheibh seems quite an anti-climax after Ben Lui but it too looks a fine peak when seen from the A85 road to the north; it presents a fierce rocky wall in this direction, so it is best to return to the bealach above Coire Fionn.\n\nEnjoy the last of the days fine views, over towards Ben Cruachan. The initial descent from the bealach is very steep so care should be taken. Further down the terrain becomes much easier and follows the Fionn Choirein burn directly down to where the path emerged from the forest at the steel gate early in the day. Retrace your outward route back down through the trees to the start. You probably won't mind getting wet feet in the Lochy for the last few metres to the car park.",

    "summary": "Ben Macdui is Britain's second highest peak, and unlike Ben Nevis, Macdui is situated in the centre of a vast wilderness. The best approaches are from Deeside, avoiding the ski areas on Cairngorm; this makes an excellent long hillwalk in good weather conditions.",
    "description": "Park at the large National Trust car park at the Linn of Dee; there is a charge. Before beginning the walk, it is worth heading back to the road and having a look at the Linn of Dee on the far side, where the River Dee plunges through a narrow rocky defile, spanned by the road bridge. Return to the car park, and this time take the footpath which leaves it to the north. This path through the forest has a 'boardwalk' surface in parts, and soon curves east and passes through a gate to join the main landrover track heading up Glen Lui. Turn left up this track, which soon crosses the Lui Water, leaves the forest and continues up the more empty glen.\n\nAfter a couple more kilometres the track passes below a plantation and then enters the beautiful pinewoods around Derry Lodge. This former shooting lodge is boarded up; it is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland following its purchase of the vast Mar Lodge estate. Just south of here is Bob Scott's, an open refuge for walkers; please help to maintain this by carrying out any rubbish when you pass back this way as it has been badly abused by some. Continue past Derry Lodge, forking right to pass the mountain rescue building and cross the Derry Burn via a footbridge. On the far side turn left across the flats; the path is boggy for some distance before becoming excellent once back amongst the pines. These gradually become more scattered as the route continues up Glen Luibeg.\n\nThe path forks just before an area of fenced, regenerating woodland. From here, if you have plenty of energy, you could join the route up Càrn a'Mhaim and then follow its fine arête to reach Ben Macdui. Otherwise, for the shorter, Sròn Riach route, take the right fork, which gently curves round the hillside to the right to continue up into upper Glen Luibeg, which is bare of trees. There are grand views up the glen of the route up Sròn Riach and the grand cliffs of Coire Sputan Dearg. After a couple more kilometres, the burn forks and its right branch must be crossed; this is usually straightforward but may require a detour upstream after wetter weather. Once on the far side, follow the path which begins the climb up Sròn Riach in earnest. The path is good and the climb is steady, but long. The top of Sròn Riach is a short-lived releif, as across a shallow dip the climb begins again, this time close to the edge of broken cliffs which plummet down to Lochan Uaine. Continue ascending close to the cliff edge until you reach the cairn on Coire Sputan Dearg, which is on the edge of the Macdui plateau.\n\nFrom here, break off left across the plateau, crossing another shallow dip to begin the final climb. Just short of the summit is a roofless stone shelter; this was the Sapper's bothy, built by OS surveyors in the 1840s when they were trying to calculate whether Ben Macdui or Ben Nevis was Britain's highest peak. Continue beyond this shelter to reach the large cairn, trig point and view indicator on the summit of Ben Macdui. At 1309 metres, this is now known to be the second highest point in the UK; it is reputedly haunted by a huge, shadowy apparition known as the Grey Man.\n\nThe view is extensive although the tundra-like plateau robs it of much depth. Head back towards the Coire Sputan Dearg cliffs (keeping well back from the corniced edge in winter), and this time turn left and follow the path which descends northeast, coming up from Loch Etchachan.\n\nIn the 1800s this was the pony track to the summit of Macdui, and was used by Queen Victoria when she ascended the mountain, somewhat hampered by the vast skirts of the time. Break to the right off the path to reach the bealach at 1053m below Creagan a'Choire Etchachan. You can either head up to the top of this minor peak, or skirt its southwestern flanks. Continue across the 1014 bealach between the Creagan and Derry Cairngorm itself.\n\nHead uphill across the awkward boulderfield to the ridge of Derry Cairngorm. The summit is towards the far end, and although much lower than Ben Macdui it is still a substantial peak at 1155 metres. From Deeside it is the most prominent summit of the range, and was once simply known as Cairngorm; in more recent times the 'Derry' was added to distinguish it from the Speyside Cairngorm. As might be expected, it is a fine viewpoint for Deeside, whilst Ben Macdui looks impressive above the great cliffs. Continue southeast across more boulders before reaching the good path that leads down to the bealach and across to Càrn Crom.\n\nAscend briefly to reach Carn Crom, the final rise on the end of the ridge. From here, descend southeast, still on a path, to the crags of Creag Bad an t-Seabhaig. Wind down through these to return to the pinewoods around Derry Lodge, and follow the track back to the Linn of Dee.",

    "description": "The walk begins from the A85 just east of Ben More farm. It is just possible to park carefully just off the road along here; alternatively there is a large layby half a mile further east at the west end of Loch Iubhair. Look out for a low wooden sign beside the A85 marked 'Ben More'; this indicates a small path which inelegantly crosses the ditch to join a track just above the farm; turn left up this. The track winds to and fro uphill, passing under the pylons, to reach a gate at 300m.\n\nGo through the gate and take the stepped path to begin the ascent of the steep slope ahead. The ascent is unrelenting and the height of the slope was much foreshortened when seen from below, but the climb isn't quite as steep as its formidable reputation amongst walkers, and the views back are superb. The path keeps left of the ill-defined lower section of the Sloc Curraidh, a corrie high on Ben More.\n\nThe high corrie of the Sloc Curraidh has a very steep headwall and can be a dangerous trap in bad weather, or more especially in winter or spring when it is prone to avalanche - there have been fatalities. From about 800 metres there is a drystone dyke along the ridge round the north side of the corrie, and the path keeps just to the left of this (note that on the OS 1:25 000 maps the dyke is erroneously marked as a stream). Continue the ascentto reach the steepest section of the climb, gaining the rocky shoulder of Cuidhe Chrom. Once atop this the going becomes a little easier and the corrie is now below; the path swings left a little to permit views of Loch Tay before climbing the final slopes.\n\nThe summit of Ben More is marked by a large cairn and at 1174 metres there are no higher mountains in Britain anywhere further south. It is a wonderful viewpoint, from the fine form of Ben Lui in the west, round a great ark of the mountains of the southern Highlands to Ben Lawers above Loch Tay. There is a trig point a short distance beyond the cairn atop a rocky outcrop and this looks south to the elegant peak of Stob Binnein - the next destination for the walk. The descent between the two peaks is considerable, but there is a clear path. The route down from Ben More is rocky at first, with one short wall requiring a move of scrambling - though this can be avoided by diverting a little to the left. Further down the slopes are grassier though the path is a little eroded, and the Bealach Eadar da-Bheinn (the pass between the two hills) is reached at 862 metres, marked by an enormous boulder.\n\nBeyond the bealach the ascent up to Stob Binnein begins. Again the path is clear and it zig-zags slightly to ease the long climb. There are no special difficulties and the small, flat summit of Stob Binnein should be reached without incident. At 1165 metres it may be slightly lower than Ben More, but Stob Binnein is the finer and more elegant peak. The view south takes in much of the Trossachs seen over a foreground of Stob Binnein's south ridge. This ridge too carries a path, this one leading to Inverlochlarig in the glen above Balquhidder - a long distance from the start by road.\n\nUnless you are undertaking a traverse, you should descend back down the north ridge to the bealach once more. From the bealach the descent path begins gently at first by desceding across the slopes below Ben More. Further down the descent becomes steeper and more direct by a burn. This leads all the way down to the glen and is boggy and slightly eroded in places. Once in the glen pick up the track and follow this down the glen; it eventually reaches the gate where the track was left earlier; pass through to return down the zigzags and eventually the A85 and the start of the walk.",

    "description": "Opposite the track for Dhiseig there is a large parking area on grass, just east of a bridge, on the shore side of the A8035. Start by heading up the track towards Dhiseig and keeping straight ahead at the entrance to the house continuing on the footpath.\n\nHead straight through a gate and then bear slightly right to follow a path alongside the Abhainn Dhiseig which tumbles down in a small gorge. As you climb the views behind of Ulva and other smaller islands improve. At a fence bear left to follow it to a gate and go through the gate. Here two sets of paths have been worn both of which converge higher up the hill, either bear right to continue to follow the Abhainn Dhiseig or follow the worn ground straight ahead SSE - the latter route is boggier and slightly less attractive.\n\nSoon the top of the peak of Ben More can be seen directly ahead, with the flank of An Gearna on the left to the east. Aim directly for Ben More, crossing a side stream at a clear crossing point with a worn path ignoring the path that branches off towards An Gearna. Soon the path runs alongside the Abhainn Dhiseig passing some very ruined buildings - marked on the map, but now only piles of stones, and then crossing the stream at an easy spot to continue uphill on the far side.\n\nPass a series of waterfalls on the left and follow the path, which becomes increasingly stony and eroded as you climb. The path keeps fairly close to the stream at first, but it is also possible to head directly up the more grassy ground to the right or southwest. As the ridge becomes more defined, a series of small cairns marks the clear path, which is now stony and scree-covered in places. On the steepest ground it ascends in small zig zags until the gradient eases onto the summit ridge.\n\nFrom here the views become much more dramatic, with the ridge route from A' Chioch coming into view. Follow the ridge southeast to reach the large summit shelter and tiny stumps of the remains of the trig point at 966m. To the south the ridge extends dramatically whilst just to the south of the summit is the start of the scramble route heading eastnortheast to A'Chioch.\n\nOn a clear day the mainland summits such as Ben Cruachan can clearly be seen and there are great views over most of Mull and to Ulva. Whilst it is possible to descend via A'Chioch this route is much better and easier as an ascent route up Ben More.

This leads past the independent hostel and field centre and heads through a gate. Ignore a track off left, instead continuing until the glen track crosses the Allt Poll an Droighinn on a concrete bridge. On the far side you can shortcut a zig-zag by heading straight ahead and rejoining the main track.\n\nFurther on is the isolated white-washed holiday cottage of Glenbain. Continue past Glenbain up the glen, now on a good path, passing to the right of a plantation after about another kilometre. Shortly after this the path forks; the signed right branch heads for the Traligill caves, popular with pot-holers, but to continue our route towards the mountains keep left. Keep on the north side of Gleann Dubh, which becomes narrower and steep sided.\n\nAfter 4.5km or so from the start the climb begins in earnest. A boggy section is followed by a badly eroded path climbing up the north side of the Allt a' Choinne Mhill. Much higher up the gradient relents into a shallow grassy corrie. The path soon crosses the burn and then climbs up towards the base of a band of quartzite crags. These are most easily ascended as a rocky staircase not far to the right of the burn. There are a few cairns that may help mark the route.\n\nAbove the line of crags an upper corrie is reached, with the bealach between Conival and Beinn an Fhurain beyond. Now the route begins to head up the north ridge of Conival on a stony path; there are a fine views looking over into Coire a'Mhadaidh, its lochan overshadowed by the impressive quartzite buttresses of Na Tuadhan.\n\nHigher up is a better defined section of ridge, grassy going giving relief from the stones for a while. Beyond this the ridge climbs again, with some fine crags on the SW side, eventually reaching the summit cairn of Conival at a junction of three ridges. The cairn takes the form of a wind-shelter and has grand views looking back along Loch Assynt.\n\nThe east ridge leads the eye across masses of scree slopes to Ben More Assynt; traversing the ridge is very rough going and more time consuming than you might expect. Head east and then descend traces of a path down an initial slope of crags and boulders. There is then a stony arête before another descent down to the bealach. Beyond this the ridge climbs again with more stones and scree, climbing up to point 974 before descending steeply.\n\nClimb more stones for the final ascent to the summit of Ben More Assynt. At 998m this is the highest mountain over a vast area of Northern Scotland as well as being the second Munro of the day; the view is of a majestic, desolate, sweeping bare wilderness in all directions.\n\nThe ridge leading south from Ben More Assynt is said to be a challenging scramble, but would lead many miles from the nearest road. Instead, retrace your outward route back along the rocky ridge to Conival.\n\nFrom the summit of Conival, turn north to continue retracing your steps the way you came, enjoying the superb views over Loch Assynt.

The upper part of the mountain is owned and maintained by conservation charity the John Muir Trust and the path on the lower part is maintained by the Nevis Landscape Partnership. To begin the walk, park at the Visitor Centre in Glen Nevis; there is a charge. Cross the new bridge over the River Nevis and then turn right and briefly follow the river bank before turning left at a sign, heading up a path between a wall and a fence.\n\nCross a stile at the top of this and go ahead across a track to meet the original path which started at the Ben Nevis Inn on the left; turn right up the rising path. Follow the wide path which climbs across the hillside. After passing above a small plantation the path from Glen Nevis Youth Hostel joins in from the right (this path leads directly from the Hostel to the main path and gives a shorter route; but there is little car parking at the Youth Hostel). Further on the path doubles back on itself to ascend the steeper, rockier slopes in a wide zigzag. There are grand views up Glen Nevis to the Mamores, with Stob Ban prominent.\n\nThe path crosses a couple of footbridges over small streams and curves round, climbing above the valley of the Red Burn. As the head of the burn is approached the path takes a very sharp left turn; please don't use the old path ahead which is eroded and loose. The correct path winds up much more easily to reach the plateau that holds Loch Meall an t-Suidhe, known as the half way lochan - which is slightly optimistic. The walk doesn't approach the actual loch though, keeping well to the right.\n\nAs the path begins to climb once more, a junction is reached. Turn right (the path keeping left heads round below the North Face of the mountain). After another half kilometre the path crosses the cascading upper Red Burn stream. The path is good at this point, but after a couple more bends becomes much rougher, a well-worn route through the boulders and scree, climbing relentlessly in a series of very wide zigzags - please stick to the path here to avoid worsening erosion.\n\nMuch higher up, the path passes above the steep screes which fall to the right into the head of Five Finger Gully. This has been the scene of many fatalities in descent, when walkers attempting to avoid the North Face of the mountain steer too wide a course and heading too far south and fall into the gully. In good weather, the views of the Glen far below are superb. The top and Càrn Dearg - fringed by great cliffs - comes into view on the left.\n\nThe gradient now eases as the beginning of the summit plateau is reached. The path passes close to the top of Tower gully, and, just before the summit, the vertigo-inducing top of Gardyloo gully. The summit of Ben Nevis is the highest mountain in the British Isles. The summit area has several memorials, a trig point, and many cairns; some of the memorials have been removed in recent years to prevent the area looking a mess. There are also the remains of the (meteorological) observatory which operated here at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th centuries.\n\nThe view is tremendously extensive and covers much of the Highlands, but there is nothing more dramatic than peering down the north side, across or down the massive cliffs; again, do not approach if there is snow as there could be cornices of overhanging snow which could collapse if you step on them.. You may spot rock-climbers coming up Tower Ridge or other classic climbs.\n\nThe return is made by the same route. In misty conditions and with snow covering the path, very careful navigation can be required to steer a course between Gardyloo Gully and Five Finger Gully. Follow a bearing of 231 degrees for 150 metres, and then a bearing of 281 degrees, to pass the most dangerous section. Once down - a celebration will be in order.",

Although the mountains themselves are not particularly distinguished, the approach walk leads through natural pine and birch forest and is very picturesque, though also very wet. Beinn Dubhchraig offers a fine view down Loch Lomond, whilst the Ben Lui looks simply magnificent from Ben Oss.",
    "description": "There is a large car park off the A82 road, reached by taking the turning for Dalrigh; keep left and the car park is on the left. Beinn Dubhcraig can be seen from here - the outline of the ridge rising over the trees. The walk begins by continuing along the tarmac lane to cross the West Highland Way and then an old stone bridge - the White Bridge or Drochaid Bhan in Gaelic. On the far side of the river, turn right onto a smaller track. This soon runs close by the railway line (which is on your left). The track then swings left to cross over the railway on a bridge.\n\nOn the far side go through the gate. A path goes off to the right across open ground from here, aiming for the footbridge over the Allt Gleann Auchreoch just above its confluence with the River Cononish. Once across the burn turn left upstream. You are now entering the beautiful pinewood known as Coille Coire-Chuilc, a remnant of the original Caledonian Forest.\n\nThe path continues to be sodden, running a short distance above the river at first before heading southwest, keeping to the north side of the Allt Coire Dubhchraig - a substantial side-stream. Several waterfalls add to the beauty of the setting, despite the wet going. Further on a broken fence is passed through beside a now defunct stile.\n\nThe path continues to be boggy but beautiful, with one particularly fine waterfall over the left. The pines have given way to birches by this point but soon these too are left behind for more open ground (though there are Sitka plantations further right and on the other side of the river); cross over a subsidiary burn at one point. The path becomes much better underfoot and continues beside the Allt Coire Dubhchraig. At one point the stream flows through a series of steep-sided rocky pools, and further on the ascent steepens where the water flows through a small gorge. Higher up the path peters out but continuing in the same direction, the broad ridge is reached.\n\nOnce on the flat back of the ridge a fairly clear path leads southeast for a short and straightforward final climb to Beinn Dubhchraig - with only around 80m of ascent along the broad ridge. There is a superb view south down Loch Lomond, flanked by its Ben and also taking in scores of hills. Return back down the ridge to where you first gained it; the path heads very briefly southwest before continuing to the left of a series of small lochans.\n\nBeyond these the path descends more steeply down rockier ground to reach the Bealach Buidhe, overlooking Loch Oss. Continue on the path to the far side of the bealach. Look out for a tiny cairn that marks the point to leave the clearer path - an old stalkers route across the flank of Ben Oss. Instead follow a fainter path that heads west up a grassy slope at first; soon this path becomes better defined and leads up to the northeastern top of Ben Oss.\n\nA short descent leads to a minor bealach before the final, easier ascent to Ben Oss begins. This follows a better defined ridge heading just west of south, with a good path leading to the summit cairn. At 1029m Ben Oss is a fine and substantial mountain in its own right, but the far more majestic Ben Lui set just to the west completely dominates the view - looking nothing short of magnificent.\n\nReturn over the northeast top and down to the bealach with Beinn Dubhchraig. Do not attempt to descend north from here as the bealach is guarded by crags. Instead it is necessary to reascend eastwards, retracing your steps along the path back up towards Beinn Dubhcraig. Once you are beyond the lochans on the ridge head northeast to reach the point where you first gained the ridge. From here reverse your ascent route from earlier in the day, heading back down beside the Allt Coire Dubhchraig. The path leads back down to reach the birch and pinewoods, backed by views of Ben Challum; continue right back to the start.",

    "description": "The walk starts along the track leading down to Coiletir from the Glen Etive road; there is a good sized parking layby off the opposite side of the road. Head down this track and over the bridge over the picturesque River Etive. Beyond this a junction is reached - keep right here and follow the hydro track. At Coiletir a sign indicates a path round the cottage to the left, but it's much easier walking to stay on the hydro track that bypasses it to the right. Eventually the track reaches the Allt Mheuran.\n\nContinue to the bridge, then turn left onto a boggy path on the far side, following the burn uphill; avoid the scar on the right left from the tempoary hydro track. After approximately half a kilometre, leave the main path to begin the ascent up the north ridge of Ben Starav. Head southwest up this ridge; there is a path but the going is rough and steep as well as sometimes wet. The angle of the ridge eases between around 400 and 500 metres, beyond which the ridge becomes better defined and drier, although bouldery, and there is a path to help which begins climbing steeply. The views back up Glen Etive are superb.\n\nThe ridge levels off once more at about 800 metres, where another ridge joins in from the northwest. Follow the combined ridge southwards; it undulates at first before narrowing considerably; the final climb is over rocky and boulders.\n\nThe disintegrating cyclindrical trig point on the summit will be reached with some relief after the long climb. At 1078 metres this is the highest Munro in the local area; the view of Loch Etive, backed by Ben Cruachan, is quite sensational.\n\nFollow the ridge beyond the summit as it curves around, keeping the steep drop on your left, to reach the southeast summit. It can be tricky in mist to find the start of the ridge which descends steeply at first towards Stob Coire Dheirg. The ridge soon narrows to a fine rocky arete. It is possible to continue along the crest with simple scrambling - alternatively you can bypass the rocks by descending a little to the right and traversing beneath the top of the ridge.\n\nEither way, Stob Coire Dheirg, a Top, will be reached; at this point do not follow the false ridge to the north; the true ridge veers to the right, just south of east, with dramatic crags on its left flank. Soon the rockier section is left behind and further down the ridge broadens out and the awkwardly named col of Bealachan Lochain Ghaineamhaich is reached.\n\nThe energetic may detour southeast from here and include an extra Munro, Beinn nan Aighenan, in the day's itinerary. This involves an extra downhill section before a long climb and then an energy-sapping return to this point. Less energetic walkers will continue up the ridge to the east instead. The ridge winds to and fro and ascends the steep minor peak of Meall na Tri Tighearean before descending slightly and then climbing once more up to Glas Bheinn Mhor.\n\nGlas Bheinn Mhor is the second Munro of the day at 997 metres. Descend down the path on the grassy east ridge, which curves to the left before descending to the next bealach at 738 metres.\n\nFrom here, turn left down the glen, keeping on the right of the stream. There is a path, but the going is boggy at times. Continue down the east bank. At around NN138457 an extremely boggy path forks right to follow a fenceline back to Coiletir, but it's preferable to simply follow a fainter path by the burn to rejoin the outward route at the hydro track. From here retrace your steps back to the start.",

    "description": "There is a good sized car park (charge) at the Inveruglas Visitor Centre on the west side of Loch Lomond. There is an information centre as well as a cafe and public toilets. Ben Vane is out of view from here; the prominent conical peak visible to the southwest being A'Chrois. Begin the walk by crossing the road (with care) and turning left on the far side, passing the front of the Inveruglas power station. The giant pipes running down from Ben Vorlich drive the turbines inside. The route becomes a path, then curves right onto a track - follow this, soon returning to the roadside. After almost a kilometre turn right onto a gated tarmac road leading under the railway.\n\nSoon a large electric substation is passed. At a fork ignore a new tarmac track off right, then later ignore a track off left. Later there's a signed path off left - ignore this and continue on the road. The steep and rocky lower slopes of Ben Vorlich tower on the right whilst the more elegant summit of A'Chrois is on the left, rising above a dense blanket of forestry. Ahead is Ben Vane itself, a rough pyramid of rock and grass. Once beyond Coiregrogain the tarmac road curves round to the right, bound for the Loch Sloy dam - another part of the hydro power scheme.\n\nAt a junction turn left onto a stonier track, crossing a bridge over the a river. Four hundred metres beyond the bridge the track crosses a burn. Ignore the first boggy path off right here, instead taking a stepped path just beyond that avoids the wet ground. This climbs up to reach a low shoulder at the foot of the ridge leading up to Ben Vane. Excellent views soon open up behind over the forestry and Loch Lomond beyond.\n\nThere's a more gradual grassy section before the slope steepens again and the path climbs directly up the mountain. The going is steep and rocky, with erosion in places - zig-zagging to and fro to ease the gradient. If you are expecting the summit to be atop the slope you can see, you're going to be disappointed as several times another steep slope is revealed ahead during the climb. As you gain height there's a stunning view to the right over Loch Sloy.\n\nHigher up the ridge becomes better defined. There are a couple of false tops - one of them with a slight scramble, though there's an easier way off to either side.\n\nEventually the suprisingly flat summit area is reached; the highest cairn is at the eastern end. The view from here is given great depth by the shape of the mountain; towards Loch Lomond it is stunning but there are higher peaks all around restricting the panorama in other directions. Although it is possible to continue the walk by descending the steep west ridge before ascending to the Glas Bhealach and thus Beinn Ìme, this route is unremittingly tough going and for most walkers Ben Vane is best tackled alone, returning the same way.",

Ben Vorlich is a very popular hillwalk from Loch Earn and a fine viewpoint, whilst the continuation to Stùc a' Chròin is a more serious walk with steep, rocky ground.",
    "description": "There is rough informal parking on the verges of the minor road along the south side of Loch Earn, mostly just west of the hump-backed bridge over the Ardvorlich burn. The walk begins up the track on the opposite (east) side of the burn, passing between the urn-topped stone gateposts. Keep right at the fork below the farm cottages, crossing the bridge back to the west side of the burn. Ardvorlich House is seen ahead here, but instead turn left once over the bridge.\n\nThe track leads over stiles next to several gates. After about a kilometre and a half there is fork in the track. Take the main route to the right which continues the ascent. A little further on, cross the Allt a'Choire Bhuidhe via a footbridge; here the track ends and the route becomes a path.\n\nThis first part of the path has been much improved in recent years. It continues the climb, now across open heather slopes, towards the north side of Ben Vorlich. As height is gained the path becomes increasingly eroded as it leads up the Sgiath nam Tarmachan ridge (wings of the ptarmigan). A final steeper climb half left leads up towards the summit ridge.\n\nThe trig point is at 985 metres, with the cairn a little further east along the fine ridge being slightly lower. The position of Ben Vorlich on the southern edge of the Highlands - combined with the steepness of the slopes falling away from the summit - ensures it a superb viewpoint for much of central Scotland. For most visitors, this summit will be enough; they should return the same way.\n\nExperienced Munro-baggers may want to include Stùc a' Chròin. This is a much rockier and trickier peak, and is well seen from Ben Vorlich. To include it, follow the ridge path west at first and then curve round on it to the left to descend to the intervening bealach. From here the usual route follows the path to the bottom of the steep prow of Stùc a' Chròin, then ascending a short boulder field.\n\nA path then bears slightly right - aim for a slabby rock which can be ascended via a gully along its left edge. There are steep zig-zagging paths heading up the slope above, keeping to the right of the main buttress - care is necessary to ensure you stay on route, which ends abruptly at a cairn on the top of the prow. This section is for expert mountaineers only in winter. It is possible to avoid this ascent by descending into the coire from the bealach, descending a little into the corrie on the west side before climbing the still-steep path that zigzags up a grassy slope between the broken rocks. From there the northwest ridge can be followed to rejoin the main route at the top of the prow. From here there are great views back to Ben Vorlich.\n\nThe summit of Stùc a' Chròin is a half kilometre further south along the ridge; there are two cairns, with the higher summit being the smaller northern one. With its position on the southern edge of the Highlands, it offers unrivalled views over Scotland's central belt - a remarkable contrast to the view to the north. To the northwest Lochearnhead is seen, whilst Loch Voil can be spotted over to the west.\n\nFor the return route, the prow can be avoided on a path on the west side that keeps just below the rockier gound. Once the ridge coming down from the prow is reached at around 850m carefully take the very steep path that zig-zags down the grassy slope to the northeast. Once easier terrain is reached below the path becomes boggier and not so obvious, but in clear conditions this boggy trod contours the slopes keeping just below the ridge linking the two Munros, continuing right around to reach the NW ridge of Ben Vorlich at around 680m.\n\nA very eroded and boggy path now continues contouring, this time around the head of Coire Buidhe, before losing height as it gradually converges with and rejoins the ascent path back down to Loch Earn.",

Begin the walk by following the new path on the opposite side of the A82 southwards beside the road. The giant pipes running down from Ben Vorlich drive the turbines of the Sloy hydro-electric power station on the other side of the road. The power station was commissioned in 1950 to supply electricity to Glasgow at times of peak demand - the great advantage of hydro-schemes is that energy is stored by the height of the water and can be released very quickly. After almost a kilometre turn right onto a gated tarmac road leading under the railway.\n\nSoon a large electric substation is passed on the left - ignore a tarred track heading off right here. The steep, featureless slopes of Ben Vorlich tower on the right whilst the more elegant summit of A'Chrois is on the left, rising above a dense blanket of forestry. Ignore a turning off to the left on a minor track signed as part of the Cowal Way and Glen Loin loop. Ben Vane is now in view directly ahead, a rough pyramid of rock and grass. Beyond Coiregrogain ignore another left turn signed for the Glen Loin Loop and instead follow the tarmac road as it bends to the right towards the Loch Sloy dam - another part of the hydro power scheme that supplies water to the power station at Inveruglas via a tunnel right under Ben Vorlich.\n\nAbout a kilometre short of the dam a stone pitched footpath heads off to the right. Turn up right here to begin an unremittingly steep and tiring ascent. The path has been much improved and soon gives fine views look back to Ben Vane and towards the Loch Sloy dam.\n\nThe gradient eases only slightly as the path heads up the shallow, grassy coire of Lag Dubh. Further on it turns to the north, climbing steeply once more and then aiming up a minor rocky ridge on the western flank of Ben Vorlich. Continue up the path for a rocky section - with the first views out towards Loch Lomond visible looking back.\n\nEventually the path emerges on the main ridge of the mountain - though it's a broad and rocky affair. The path keeps to the east side at first before climbing once more, eventually leading up to reach a trig point and cairn.\n\nThe true summit of Ben Vorlich is not here but at another cairn two hundred metres further along atop a small crag. The views are excellent, with Ben Lui looking majestic to the north.\n\nIt is possible to descend over Stob nan Còinnich to Ardlui, or down the complicated terrain of the Little Hills ridge to Stuckendroin, but both of these routes end a long way from Inveruglas, so for most the best option is probably to retrace your route of ascent. Head back to the trig point - which has a sensational view of Loch Lomond and its islands - and continue retracing your steps back down the path and then the hydro road to return to the start.",

    "description": "Park at the Ben Wyvis car park (height barrier), which is signed from the A835, north of Garve. The car park is small and fills quickly; there's room for a few further cars in a layby 400m north along the road (which is a clearway for 2km here so parking along the verge is not allowed) - avoid obstructing access for local residents. If you can, share a lift. From the car park a path heads north, soon crossing the Allt a' Bhealaich Mhòir via a footbridge. Once across the stream the path soon swings right by a gate and the well trodden route which runs along the north side of the stream through the forest. Aspen, birch and rowan trees alongside the stream enliven the ascent. When a forest track is reached, go straight across to continue on the path.\n\nAfter about a kilometre the path becomes more open with younger trees. Climb more steeply, still close to the stream. Just over another kilometre uphill, the forest is left behind and open country reached, with An Cabar looking very fine ahead.\n\nThe path - expertly built to avoid the bogs - begins to ascend in a series of steps towards the top of An Cabar. The ascent is steep until a shoulder is reached, and then continues more gently to reach the 946m top of An Cabar, with a dramatic view down the steep slopes to the south.\n\nFrom An Cabar, the gradient becomes gentle, but the terrain is exposed if the weather is poor. The extensive mossy plateau provides habitat for the rare Dotterel, but the thin soils here are easily damaged by the passage of many boots. This is a nature reserve, and NatureScot encourage walkers to stick to a single line along the centre of the path - please follow this route to minimise the damage. Head over Cairn a' Chaptein and across a barely perceptable dip before ascending gently towards the summit.\n\nThe ridge narrows slightly about a third of a kilometre before the summit trig point is reached. The summit of Ben Wyvis (which means Awesome Mountain) is Glas Leathad Mòr , a Munro at 1046 metres. In clear visibility the views cover a vast swathe of northern Scotland, from Torridon to the Black Isle and Easter Ross. The sharp cone of Sgùrr Mòr in the Fannichs is easy to identify.\n\nAlthough some books recommend a descent from Tom a' Chòinnich, this crosses pathless rough ground.

    "description": "Park in the large car park half way up Glen Coe at NN170569; alternatively you can park in a smaller car park a couple of hundred metres further down the glen. The car park is often busy with coaches later in the day (and often has a bagpiper), so try to arrive fairly early. There is a fabulous view of the Three Sisters across the glen; the walk begins by climbing between Gear Aonach and Aonach Dubh. Begin by following the path down from the car park to the old track in the bottom of the glen; turn right along this track briefly and then left on the path heading down to the footbridge over the River Coe and up into Coire nan Lochan.\n\nThe excellent path climbs steadily up into Coire nan Lochan, keeping high on the left side of the valley. Much of the path surface has been improved by 'pitching' in recent years; only at one point where the path comes closer to the stream is there a rockier section requiring some simple scrambling. There are waterfalls down the valley floor and good views back down into Glen Coe, whilst the peak of Stob Coire nan Lochan is prominent ahead. Much higher up there is a small waterfall by a boulder; fork right here onto a fainter path (the main path leads up via the east ridge of Stob Coire nan Lochan - more direct but less scenic). Cross the burn and a boggier section of the path. It becomes faint on a climb up grassy ground to the west and then southwest into the upper coire. The great Pinnacle and South Buttresses of Stob Coire nan Lochan tower above here.\n\nHead northwest to gain the foot of Stob Coire nan Lochan's north ridge. Turn left up the ridge towards the summit. Although this ridge looked as jagged as a toast-rack from below, the buttresses projected out from the true ridge line and the ascent of the ridge is simply a walk on boulders, with great views down the cliffs and gullies to the left.\n\nThe top of Stob Coire nan Lochan is then reached; this peak is 1115 metres but its close connection to Bidean nam Bian means it doesn't qualify as a separate Munro. The lower section of the ridge leading up to Bidean looks intimidatingly steep from here but proves easier on close acquaintance Head down to the bealach between the peaks on gentle scree and then follow the path which keeps a little to the left on the steep section.\n\nThe summit of Bidean nam Bian is the highest in Argyll at 1150 metres. The view is superb in all directions, from Loch Etive in the southwest, passing round over a section of sea with Mull beyond, to Beinn a'Bheithir above Ballachulish and over the Aonach Eagach to Ben Nevis.\n\nThe walk continues along the fine ridge which leads towards Bidean's second Munro, Stob Coire Sgreamhach. The ridge has tremendous scenery all around and crosses a couple of minor summits; there are steep butresses falling to the north side giving real depth to the views.\n\nEventually the ridge descends to Bealach Dearg; there is a path throughout and no real difficulties. Beyond the bealach the ridge rises once more, with one steeper section of boulders to negotiate, before the summit of Stob Coire Sgreamhach is reached. At 1072 metres, this peak was promoted in 1997 to become Bidean nam Bian's second Munro summit. Again, the views are superb, especially over Buachaille Etive Beag and Buachaille Etive Mòr , and along the length of Loch Etive with Ben Starav towering above and Ben Cruachan beyond. Return to the Bealach Dearg.\n\nDescend north from the bealach into Coire Gabhail - note that a large snow patch can cover this route even well into summer. The scree gully leading down is very eroded, but there is a 'path' of sorts which descends the broken rocks just to the right of the gully on the first section; after that there is a path winding down the scree. Further down the path has been much improved in recent years, and keeps to the left side of the coire, well above the stream which flows in a gorge. At the far end of the Coire is the flat area known as the 'Lost Valley'. This was used to hide rustled cattle by the Macdonald's of Glencoe. The stream itself has been buried under rocks fallen from the mountains above; some of the boulders at the far end of the valley are as big as houses.\n\nThe path out of the Lost Valley is on the right, and climbs above the valley floor on the lower flanks of Beinn Fhada. Follow this clear path which ascends a little before descending once more on sections of pitched footpath. There is one section of easy scrambling down a rake with a steep drop on the left; this can be avoided if preferred by climbing over the end of the boulder directly ahead. Beyond this the path descends and crosses the stream on stepping stones, before taking a brief section of new path above the gorge and continuing down, eventually crossing the river on a bridge high above the waters. The path then leads back through birch woodland to the wider Glen Coe track, a short distance below the car park at the start.",

    "description": "Start from the walker's car park on the right after turning into Attadale Estate from the A890 south of Strathcarron. There is a map showing the route. Walk along the entrance driveway, bearing left towards the entrance to the Gardens. Pass some cottages on the right and when the Gardens entrance is reached turn right along the road up the Glen, away from Attadale House. The lane follows the pleasant strath, when it forks take the lower, right hand side signed for cottages and walkers. Eventually pass through a gate near the estate holiday cottages; after this the track becomes rougher. Continue along it, ignoring two turnings to the right, to reach a bridge over the River Attadale. Go right across this and follow the track as it begins to climb through birch woodland. It soon joins a new bulldozed hydro track heading uphill - hopefully the scars from this will heal with time.\n\nThere are great views back over Lochcarron backed by the peaks of Applecross. After the climb up the valley of the Abhainn Odhar, the track flattens out somewhat as it crosses undulating moors, with forestry plantations over to the right. Ignore two tracks off on the right, the second of which has a footpath signpost (for Killilan in Kintail). The track winds around, passing the small Loch an Droigan, before climbing steeply in zig-zags after passing the outflow of Loch na Caillich.\n\nThe gradient then eases once more and Bidein a'Choire Sheasgaich and Lurg Mhòr finally come into view at last - though still distant - and eventually the track heads gently downhill into a new, empty landscape. After descending down the empty Srath Feith a'Mhadaidh for over a kilometre, the original track climbs slightly and then drops again towards the wide Uisage Dhubh or Black Water River, curving to the south to reach an attractive cast-iron bridge where the river flows through a small ravine. Cross the bridge and continue on the track which turns left on the far side (you can avoid some of the hydro track by keeping on the old track closer to the river).\n\nA kilometre and a half further on a pair of lonely buildings is reached at Bendronaig Lodge. The first of these is a lodge used by stalkers, but just beyond is the second building. This is maintained by the Attadale Estate as an open bothy for the use of walkers. Whether staying here, camping nearby or just popping in, please repay the estate's generosity by carrying out all your rubbish and keeping the place tidy; flush the toilet by filling the cistern using the bucket in the stream outside.\n\nBeyond the bothy, a bulldozed track continues east. This soon reaches a junction and a rickety footbridge over the Allt Coire na Sorna (the hydro track avoids this). Take the branching track that climbs up the glen on the north side of the Allt Coire na Sorna. It climbs up into Coire na Sorna before crossing a low bealach and descending slightly to the lonely shores of Loch Calavie, beloved of fishermen.\n\nFollow the track for a short distance along the northern shore, to where the Allt Coire Calavie flows into the loch. Here, turn left and climb up beside the stream. The going is usually a little wet; after a long, fairly sustained climb the gradient eases; aim a little to the right to reach the bealach between Bidein a'Choire Sheasgaich and Lurg Mhor. Turn right to tackle Lurg Mhòr first.\n\nA surprisingly good path makes for an easy ascent, with two steepish sections before the cairn is reached, and good views behind of the Bidein. The summit cairn of Lurg Mhor, 986 metres, is prized as undoubtedly amongst the remotest of all Munros, and is situated close to the edge of its steep northern crags. East of the summit the ridge descends and dramatically narrows to make a scramble across exposed slippery slabs necessary for any walkers wishing to make a detour to the eastern top of Meall Mòr (not included in the distance and times for this route); instead, return to the bealach.\n\nThis time follow the path westwards as it winds up towards the Bidein. This ascent steepens towards the end, curving right to reach the narrow, graceful summit ridge of Bidein a'Choire Sheagaich. Nicknamed 'Cheesecake' by some hill-goers who are unsure of Gaelic pronunciation, this peak, although lower at 945 metres, is much finer than Lurg Mhor, it's airy summit being a just reward for the effort of reaching it. Descend southwest back along the summit ridge, and then steeply down (pathless) to a small lochan just below. From here, follow the undulating, rocky ridge out to the minor final bump of Sàil Riabhach, and continue to its termination to the west.\n\nFrom here, a route can be picked out down the primarily heathery slopes to the path in Coire na Sorna. Turn right down this path to return to Bendronaig Lodge - and the start of the long, long track back to Attadale.",

    "description": "Park in the large layby off the A832 around 250 metres to the east of the Dundonnell Hotel. The walk begins a little further along the road (heading away from the Hotel), turning off onto a path to the right just before the pair of bungalows to pass behind them, through a gate and up the hillside. The path, which is a little boggy in places, zig-zags to and fro as it climbs up onto the ridge of Meall Garbh. Try to keep to this old path up this ridge rather than following the clearer path ahead towards the Allt a Mhuillin, which is a boggier route. There are fine views along the rocky ridge of Meall Garbh; beyond the path contours round the smoothly-contoured slopes at the head of the valley, before beginning to climb once more towards Sròn a Choire. There are great views to the north over towards the Summer Isles.\n\nBeyond Sròn a' Choire the route climbs slightly to reach a col which is almost paved with flat sandstone slabs. From here, climb steeply up the scree and boulder ridge to the south; there's a worn path heading up the flank to the ridge of the ridge line. Eventually a short climb to the left leads to the trig point on the summit of Bidein a'Ghlas Thuill. This is the highest of An Teallach's two Munros at 1062 metres. It has extensive views in all directions but all eyes will be pointing southwest, where a truly stupendous panorama of Sgùrr Fiona and the Corrag Buidhe pinnacles make an amazing backdrop to the void of Coire Toll an Lochain. There is no more impressive sight amongst Scottish mountains.\n\nFollow the rocky ridge southwest, with immense views on the left side. The ridge descends to a bealach before rising intimidatingly steeply towards Sgùrr Fiona.\n\nThis ridge can either be followed by scrambling up it directly near the corrie edge, or follow an easier path across the northern face of Sgùrr Fiona to instead reach its summit up its rocky but straightforward northwest ridge. Either way, the cairn on this second Munro at 1060 will be reached. This is a finer summit than Bidein a' Ghlas Thuill but doesn't share that peak's sudden drama; its view along Corrag Buidhe is very impressive nonetheless.\n\nContinue along the ridge; a path leads down to a bealach at the foot of Lord Berkeley's Seat, a fearsome-looking pinnacle which actually overhangs Coire Toll an Lochain. Lord Berkeley is supposed to have sat on the top with his legs dangling over the edge whilst he smoked a pipe. Here a decision must be made; the ascent of the Seat is fairly simple though exposed scrambling, but beyond the Seat, the ridge offers more scrambling over the multiple pinnacles of Corrag Buidhe. The final descent off Corrag Buidhe is a graded rock climb and scene of several fatal accidents; if you've gone this far, it is necessary to head back a little and look for a way down to the bypass path which is on the right hand side of the ridge.\n\nAlternatively, you can avoid the scrambling by taking a bypass path that begins from the foot of Lord Berkeley's Seat. This descends a little and cuts across the west flank of Corrag Bhuidhe; when it forks, the higher route is the easier option. Whether you've taken the bypass or the ridge, the two routes rejoin beyond Corrag Buidhe Buttress and the main scrambling difficulties are left behind. You can continue along a narrow ridge, or descend stony ground more directly to head to the bealach at the foot of Stob Cadha Gobhlach.\n\nThe ridge then climbs up steeply, then eases before reaching the final sharp peak of Stob Gadha Gobhlach, with a good retrospective view of Corrag Buidhe. Descend an eroded path to another bealach before climbing once more to the final, more rounded peak of Sàil Liath.\n\nFrom Sàil Liath take a long last look back at the magnificent cirque you have completed. From here, a fairly broad ridge descends southeast at first; as this begins to to steepen, bear right slightly down the slope to avoid any crags; this part of the descent is stony and loose. Aim well to the south of the small Lochan na Brathan to eventually reach the stalkers' path from Corrie Hallie to Shenavall a short distance beyond.\n\nTurn left along this path which undulates before joining a vehicle track; keep left here. The vehicle track now leads all the way back to the A832. This is some fine woodland in Gleann Chaorach; at one point the track fords the stream in this glen. If the water is high there is an alternative footbridge which can be reached with muddy boots. Just over two kilometres further on the track, after passing through a gate, joins the A832 at Corrie Hallie. This is parking here, but if you have left your car at the start of the walk in Dundonnell you have another three kilometres or more of road walking to do - turn left along the road.",

    "description": "The walk begins from the car park adjacent to St Paul's Church in Kinlochleven; it is signed 'Grey Mare's Tail' from the main road (it is no longer possible to start from the former Mamore Lodge Hotel). From the Kinlochleven car park follow the path from the edge of the car park into the woods; it is signed for 'Spean Bridge' and 'Corrour Station'. Almost at once the path reaches a t-junction; turn left here. After a short distance on the surfaced path, keep right as signed for Loch Èilde Mòr. When the path forks, keep left, crossing a small burn. The route climbs up through the deciduous woodland and gives increasingly good views back over Kinlochleven and Loch Leven behind. As the path climbs the original zig-zagging stalkers path has been short-cutted by a variety of eroded, direct routes; it is best to keep to the original route to avoid worsening the erosion. Soon the trees are left behind and more open moorland is reached.\n\nContinue on the clear path across the moor until it eventually reaches a vehicle track. Turn left here very briefly before turning right again to continue in the original direction on another stalkers path. This slopes uphill before crossing a stream and then beginning to climb across the steep flanks of Sgòr Èilde Beag. There are good views over Loch Èilde Mòr and to the Blackwater Reservoir and Dam in the distance. Watch out for a sharp zig-zag to the left at one point, marked by a tumbledown cairn; there is a faint path continuing straight ahead created by walkers who have missed this.\n\nThe route traverses round Sgòr Èilde Beag, curving to the left, keeping high above the loch but below the cliffs. There is an impressive but daunting view of Sgùrr Èilde Mòr across the lochan; our route saves this peak for the return journey. Continue on the stalkers path until it reaches a four-way junction. The left branch climbs up towards Binnein Mòr , whereas the sharp right turn heads for Sgùrr Èilde Mòr . Continue ahead on a path which slopes downhill a little, curving to the left before beginning to descend into the Coire a Bhinnein valley. The clear path descends to the stream in this valley via a series of zigzags, before crossing the stream. Continue downstream for a short distance before the stalkers path heads off to the left, beginning to climb once more.\n\nKeep to the clear but somewhat boggy stalkers path as it climbs across the hillsides all the way to the lochan on the bealach between Binnein Mòr and Binnein Beag. To ascend Binnein Beag, follow the faint path on the near side of this lochan which begins to climb up the broken south ridge. This ridge has boulders and scree but there is a path for most of the climb which helps; there is a short, avoidable scrambly section near the top.\n\nThe summit of Binnein Beag is 943 metres, making it the second lowest of the Mamores Munros. This belies the fact that its remote position makes it perhaps the hardest of the range to reach. There are extensive views over the bleak headwaters of Glen Nevis, with Ben Nevis towering to the north together with the Grey Corries. The most impressive part of the view however is looking back down the route of ascent to the lochan far below, with Binnein Mòr towering above. Return back down to the lochan by the route of ascent, and all the way back across the Coire a Bhinnein valley and up the zig-zag path on the far side.\n\nReturn to the junction mentioned earlier, then turn left towards the west ridge of Sgùrr Èilde Mòr. Follow the path as it climbs round onto the northwest face before making a final climb up to the crest of the west ridge via steep, eroded scree. The summit of Sgùrr Èilde Mòr is 1010m, just a short distance along this ridge to the left. It has a stunning view across the lochan to the main Mamores ridge.\n\nDescend back down the path and follow it to the junction of stalkers paths mentioned earlier. Turn left here to retrace the stalkers path back round and down to the vehicle track below Loch Èilde Mòr . To vary the return to Kinlochleven, you can turn right along the stalkers track, passing a stone bench with a superb view of Loch Leven. Just after the bench turn left onto a path heading downhill. This descends into the valley ahead to another path junction; again turn left. Follow the main path through the woodland, keeping left once again at a waymarked junction, to descend a steep, eroded trench-like section through the trees. Turn right beyond this to reach a footbridge. You can visit the impressive Grey Mare's Tail waterfall by detouring straight ahead here; otherwise cross the bridge and climb the steps before following the path back to the car park.",

Soon the trees are left behind and more open moorland is reached.\n\nContinue on the clear path across the moor until it approaches a vehicle track; it forks just before reaching it. Take the left fork, reaching the track and continuing straight across it on another stalkers' path. This path climbs across the moor, later crossing a stream and heading up the far bank before climbing around the southern flank of Sgùrr Èilde Beag. Watch out for a sharp zig-zag to the left uphill, as there is a peaty path continuing directly ahead which peters out before Loch Èilde Mòr . Above a few zig-zags the path contours once more, reaching a fork. Bear left here to head uphill, soon joining another old stalkers path coming in from the right.\n\nFollow this path as it climbs diagonally to the left; initially it crosses a landslipped area and requires care, but beyond this it continues as a very fine graded old path zig-zagging to find an easy route up an otherwise extremely steep slope. Eventually it reaches the ridge just short of Sgùrr Èilde Beag, and from here easy grass slopes lead up to the first minor peak. There are truly sensational views across to Sgùrr Èilde Mòr across the irregular loch of Coire nan Lochan far below.\n\nNow continue along the broad ridge - sometimes grassy, sometimes rocky, across a bealach where another stalkers path comes up from the right. Continue uphill along the ridge to climb to another top at 1062m. From here you can see the ridge running out to Binnein Mòr to the north backed by Ben Nevis and the Grey Corries.\n\nFollow this ridge northwards, dropping slightly to a bealach before ascending a fine ridge to reach the summit of Binnein Mòr . At 1130m this Munro is the highest of all the Mamores, and is a wonderful airy perch with spectacular views. The peak of Binnein Beag far below looks so small in comparison that it is hard to believe it is a Munro. Retrace your steps along the ridge back to the 1062m minor summit.\n\nThis time follow the narrowing ridge southwest - initially on grass, then shattered rock - down to a bealach. The ridge narrows in places but there are no real difficulties on the ascent to Na Gruagaichean, which is grassy initially before becoming very rocky.\n\nThe summit cairn is reached without too much ascent; at 1056m this is the second Munro of the day. The best part of the view is northwest, where the main Mamores ridge drops steeply and reascends even more dramatically to Na Gruagaichean's northwest Top, with Ben Nevis as backdrop.\n\nRather than heading over to this top, follow the easier south ridge which sweeps down to Leachd na h-Aire and gives great views down to Kinlochleven and Loch Leven. From the cairn on the Leachd, descend WSW down initially grassy ground. This soon steepens and there are traces of a path to ease the descent on the steep section, which ends with a crossing of boulders. Beyond the boulders the descent continues, now pathless.\n\nThis part of the descent is long and tiring, and care is needed with navigation; recompense is in the superb view of Loch Leven ahead. There is a deer fence before the Mamore Lodge - Loch Èilde Mòr track is reached; this is best avoided by keeping south in the later stages to meet the track near where it passes through the deer fence. Turn briefly left along the track, then turn right onto a path that soon heads through a gate in the fence lower down. Continue down this path that eventually leads down to the woods, descending to reach a footbridge near the Grey Mare's Tail. Turn left over this bridge and climb very briefly before rejoining the outward route just a few metres from the car park at the start.",

When driving from Broadford, the car park is up a track (signed) to the right just after the road crosses the bridge over the Allt na Dunaiche. Return to the road and cross the bridge to reach the start of the walk, which heads up the other side of the stream. Or take the path from the far end of the car park which heads back down the stream and then turn left to cross the stream on the road and head left up the path. The first part of the walk is on an excellent path which heads gently up the moor; it leads through two gates above a steep wooded gorge. The area is owned by the John Muir Trust, a charity that protects wild places, and also maintains the path. You can find out more and support their work by joining at http://www.johnmuirtrust.org/\n\nFurther on there are views down into a second gorge carved by the Allt na Dunaiche. After a kilometre and a half the path crosses the stream, and three hundred metres further on crosses a second stream before beginning the climb up Coire Uaigneich on the newly repaired path. The route turns sharp right as it reaches the grassy bowl of Fionna-choire - ignore other paths heading straight on (if you reach a huge boulder, you've missed the turning). The route is slightly indistinct for a while, zigzagging up the steep slopes to the right once the edge of the cliffs is passed. Higher up is a wide scree slope where traces of a zig-zag path ease the ascent.\n\nAt one point it looks like many people have headed further right; instead climb slightly left, clambering over some fallen boulders to enter a narrower scree gully. Continue up the stony gully which thankfully is the steepest and loosest part of the climb. Near the top, the path heads out left and then gives much improved going, becoming clearer once again and leading up to the rim of Bla Bheinn's eastern cliffs - bear slightly right on the way up to get the best views. From here the way is clear, continuing up the slope to the left; there are spectacular views in places between the great buttresses, with a dramatic gash backed by a vertical rock wall - part of the Great Prow and famed amongst rock-climbers.\n\nFurther on is a cairn and views across to the rock peak of Clach Glas. The easiest route up Clach Glas is a rock climb graded Moderate. The going becomes very rocky as height is gained. Soon the route is funnelled up into a narrowing gully, requiring a short easy scramble to ascend the rocks at the top; alternatively the rocks on the left can be climbed from lower down the gully. Beyond this, the summit is soon reached. Bla Bheinn (the Blue Mountain) is 928 metres high, making it the only Munro on Skye that is not part of the Cuillin Ridge.\n\nThe view is magnificent, with huge sweeps of sea, mountains and islands in all directions; most of the island can be seen as well as the whole of Raasay and miles of the western seaboard. The Cuillin look fabulous to the north, but perhaps the finest feature is the aerial view of Glen Sligachan, enclosed by the contrasting peaks of Sgùrr nan Gillean on the left and Marsco on the right.\n\nThe easiest and quickest return to the start is by the route of ascent. It is possible to scramble (slightly awkwardly) to the south summit and then descend the southeast flank to a col between Abhainn nan Leac and Fionna-choire, but a steep scree run has to be descended beyond - so the outward route is probably pleasanter. A superior descent is the south ridge, but this also requires the scramble to the south summit and ends many miles from the car park.",

In good conditions this is a magnificent circuit taking in scenery from Caledonian pinewoods to a storm-swept plateau high above dramatic corries.",
    "description": "The most usual, quickest route to Braeriach is there-and-back via the Chalamain Gap from the car park part way up the ski-road. However the route described here makes a circular route and also benefits from a start through the Caledonian Pinewoods. Park at the end of the Whitewell public road (another alternative is Loch an Eilein car park); this leaves the Cairngorm road in Inverdruie and is signed for Blackpark and Tullochgrue. The walk begins by following a rough path downhill to the east from the parking area, marked with a Rothiemurchus footpath sign. The path slopes down to a much bigger one at a 't'-junction. Turn right here and continue up the well-surfaced route; there is a fine view of Braeriach ahead - a magnificent backdrop to the scattered Scots pines.\n\nContinue up the path to reach a cross-roads of well-surfaced routes; turn left here, heading for the Lairig Ghru (the Loch an Eilein route comes in from the right at this cross-roads). The path passes the pretty Loch Deo, deep in the forest, and soon reaches another junction where a path from Coylumbridge joins in from the left. Continue right, soon reaching the iron bridge over the river built by the Cairngorm Club. Cross the bridge and follow the path on the far side. After just over a kilometre another cross-roads is reached; turn right to continue up towards the Lairig Ghru. The forests are gradually left behind as the path traverses the slopes high above the Allt Druidh. A couple of kilometres further the path comes alongside the stream and the route from the Chalamain gap joins in from the left.\n\nContinue on the main path which soon crosses the burn and then climbs gently. Look out for a clear path off to the right; turn onto this newly reconstructed route. It climbs up onto the lower end of the Sròn na Lairig ridge, passing high above the Lairig and giving superb views down into the pass and across to Lurcher's Crag.\n\nWhen the summit of Sròn na Lairig is reached, cross a shallow bealach before beginning the climb up the initially wide slopes towards Braeriach; these briefly narrow to a fine ridge with truly magnificent views down the Lairig and across Coire Brochain and the vast Garbh Choire to the peaks of Cairn Toul and Sgòr an Lochan Uaine.\n\nThe summit of Braeriach, a mighty 1296 metres, is a short distance beyond, close to the edge of the cliffs, and is a wonderful viewpoint for the whole region. The easiest return is the same way, but if weather is favourable it is well worth continuing this circular route to descend via Gleann Einich. Head northwest from the summit towards the rim of Coire Ruadh, and then descent gradually west, retaining enough height to pass above the cliffs plunging down into Coire an Lochain.\n\nThis corrie cradles a surprisingly large loch; continue round above the corrie to begin the real descent northwest. After coming level with the floor of the corrie, aim more to the west to pick up the fading line of an old stalkers path.\n\nThis descends in a series of zig-zags - with stunning views ascross Gleann Einich - before eventually petering out. Rather than descending directly to glen it is better to aim a little north towards the Allt Easan na Bruaich before cutting down to avoid steep heather slopes. Cross a boggy area to gain the track. Turn right down the glen. Soon the substantial Beanaidh Bheag needs to be crossed; this can be done on stones in dry weather but may need a wade (the crossing would be impassable in spate). Further on cross a bridge over the main Am Beannaidh. When the track forks, keep to the lower track along the glen. Gradually the bleakness of the empty glen vanishes as the pines of Rothiemurchus Forest are reached; this is a stunning section.\n\nContinue down the glen for several kilometres before bearing right at a fork to reach the cross-roads passed on the outward route. This section is really enjoyable if you aren't too tired, with some wonderful old pines. Go straight ahead at the cross-roads, and then look out for the rough path on the left about a kilometre on that leads you back to Whitewell.",

The directness does at least ensure the first Munro of the day is reached fairly quickly; there's a large first cairn before the slope eases. The actual summit cairn is just beyond the trig point at 975m. There are excellent views all around, and the best part of the days walk now stretches ahead.\n\nThe path follows a delightful ridge, curving left at first, then right and then left again, bypassing the crest of the final stretch of ridge on the left side before reaching the bealach. A path descends SE from here, making possible a much shorter walk if only the one summit is required. To continue the main route, a steeper climb begins from the bealach up towards the second Munro.\n\nThe gradient eases somewhat as the ascent continues round the edge of a scooped corrie to reach the summit cairn of Braigh Coire Chruinn-bhalgain, the central of Beinn a'Ghlò's three peaks. Finding the route to the next bealach requires care in poor visibility; you can either head over the minor summit E of point 1016m, then continue along the plateau edge until a safe descent, or you can follow a path from point 1016m that bypasses the ridge on the left side before petering out for the steeper descent of the eastern slope, joining a clearer path lower down.\n\nThe path heads down to the Bealach an Fhiodha, losing another 150m. Across the other side the path keeps left at first and later joins another path (coming in from the right) before making a rising traverse up onto the ridge of Càrn nan Gabhar - probably a tiring ascent by this point in the day. Once on the ridge the ascent is gentle but the ground becomes very stony. Bypass a prominent first cairn, and then the trig point, before finally reaching the well-built cairn on the true summit beyond.\n\nCàrn nan Gabhar is the highest summit of Beinn a'Ghlò at 1129 metres, with fine views into the wilds around the head of Glen Tilt. The return route to Loch Moraig is long and tiring. Retrace your steps initially; you can then head over Airgiod Bheinn for the return though the far side is very steep and stony. Our route instead retraces steps back to the Bealach an Fhiodha and then heads down the east side of the burn leading south. Further down the path becomes increasingly boggy, and it is best to cross to a clearer path on the opposite side of the burn.\n\nThe path crosses the burn twice more before crossing the Allt na Beinn Bige and then picking up the start of a well-constructed path which contours round the base of Beinn Bheag. Going underfoot is excellent now. Ignore a path off right, continuing until a track is reached. Turn right along this, eventually passing through a gate. Ultimately the track rejoins the outward route near the hut below Carn Liath. Retrace your steps to return to the start.",

Note that on busy weekends the car park can become full and at such times the road up Glen Muick is closed - so arrive early or plan an alternative. Continue along the track to the Spittal of Glen Muick, where there is a small wooden visitor centre and toilets. Lochnagar is the first peak on this route, so turn up the track to the right here. Follow this across the flat floor of the glen, soon crossing a bridge over the River Muick. At the far side of the glen, fork left onto a path that then meets another track at forestry surrounding the Balmoral Estate's various buildings at Allt-na-guibhsaich. Go straight across on a path up through the woods to gain the track which ascends beside the stream. After just under 1km of uphill the track crosses to the north side of the Allt na Guibhsaich; this is usually easily crossed.\n\nPass above the minor gorge of Clais Rathadan and follow the track round to the right. Further on, take the clear branch path leading off to the left - this is the main path for Lochnagar, and has been improved in recent years by stone-pitching. Follow the path as it climbs towards the bealach or col visible between the main bulk of Lochnagar on the left, and its outlying peak of Meikle Pap. The path passes a memorial to Bill Stuart, a climber who was killed on the cliffs in 1953. As you approach the bealach, the main Lochnagar path diverts off to the left, but it is really worth continuing ahead to the bealach itself.\n\nHere, the massive but domed and stony hills of the walk so far are replaced by a view across Lochnagar's famous northern corrie, a magnificent curve of buttresses cradling a small lochan. If you have the energy, you can divert up to the summit of Meikle Pap on the right for the best views. Rejoin the path for the ascent up the slope on the left, known as the Ladder. This slope is covered with large boulders but the path avoids the worst; in winter this slope is notorious for avalanches. Above the Ladder the slope eases onto a flatter plateau. Follow the edge of the cliffs (not too closely!) round to the right; in good weather you can peer down the gullies to the lochan below.\n\nAs the cliffs curve to the northwest, there is another ascent, and the minor cairn on a boulder at Cac Càrn Mòr is just beyond. Continue to reach the viewpoint indicator on the pointed rocky outcrop at Cac Càrn Beag, the true summit of Lochnagar, which a magnificent viewpoint for Deeside and the Cairngorms massif. Lochnagar was climbed by Queen Victoria, who wrote of the summit 'But alas! Nothing whatever to be seen; and it was cold, and wet, and cheerless.' Hopefully you are luckier!\n\nReturn to the Cac Càrn Mòr but this time follow the path which heads southwest across the plateau. Across a shallow bealach, the path ascends towards the rocky prow of The Stuic, which is worth detouring to for its view down to Loch nan Eun and across the Dee valley. Although The Stuic is the finest prominence on this part of the walk, the Munro summit of the White Mounth is Càrn a'Choire Bhòidheach, which is reached by a detour of about half a kilometre to the south. A local legend says that when all the snows here melt, the day of doom is drawing near - these days the snows melt every summer so perhaps Global warming has been more dramatic than previously thought! Head northwest to regain the old stalkers path, turning left onto it as it descends across the flank of the hill and crosses the Allt an Da Chraobh Bheath.\n\nThe domed hill to the north here is Càrn an t-Sagairt Beag, a humble top; to reach the next Munro, continue on the stalkers path until after it crosses a second stream, and then strike northwest uphill as soon as the going is straightforward. This brings you to the cairns on the summit of Càrn an t-Sagairt Mòr , Munro no.3 at 1047 metres; there are two cairns, with the more southerly being the higher. Just to the north is a large piece of wreckage - a part of an RAF Canberra aircraft which crashed into the hillside here in 1956. There are further fragments of wreckage spread over a wide area of the mountain.\n\nDescend southeast from the cairn to the wide, featureless bealach. This is truly bleak country, and navigation could be difficult in bad weather; the summit of Munro no.4, Cairn Bannoch at 1012 metres, is easier to spot in better conditions, with its cairn atop an outcrop, itself topping a small conical peak. Continue southeast, bypassing Cairn of Gowal, to gain an ever improving path to the final Munro, Broad Cairn. This summit can be avoided on its south side by a stalkers path, but today's bagging generation of walkers have blazed a new path over the summit cairn. This is a better viewpoint, with Loch Muick in view, whilst to the northwest the plateau collapses in the great precipices of Creag an Dubh Loch - a crag which in recent times has approached the popularity of Lochnagar itself.\n\nContinue east from the summit, descending a boulderfield to join a bulldozed track across the plateau. Follow this as it curves southeast before it curves back left to come close to the edge of the steep slopes above Loch Muick. The track runs across the top of these slopes for some distance, giving excellent views of the Loch, before it reaches the end of the plateau and descends in a series of zigzags. Cross the bridge over the Black Burn and continue on the track which still keeps some height above Loch Muick. Pass close to the boathouse near the foot of the loch, and continue straight ahead on the track to return to the Spittal of Glenmuick.",

    "description": "Take the road toward Dunvegan from Sligachan and park at the layby on the left just after the start of a track to a cottage. Begin the walk by following the track towards the white cottage. A sign indicates where the path heads off to the right before the cottage is reached. From here on, the path is easy to follow as it ascends the moor beside the Allt Dearg Mòr (Big Red Stream), which has many beautiful natural pools to add interest. The Pinnacle Ridge of Sgùrr nan Gillean slowly comes into view over to the left, looking much more impressive than it does from Sligachan.\n\nAfter about 3km the path forks - keep left here, then left again at the following fork, after which the path crosses a burn. The route now ascends the grassy lower reaches of Fionn Choire (the Fair Corrie). Bruach Na Frithe (which isn't visible from Sligachan) is the peak at the head of the corrie, on the right. The path is clear at first, but after it climbs higher and crosses the stream it can be harder to follow. If you lose it, simply continue the ascent of the corrie until reaching a rockier upper bowl.\n\nHere the path becomes clearer again as it ascends the rocky ground and scree on the left side of the corrie, with a steep finish up well-worn scree leading to the Bealach na Lice. This is a dramatic place with remarkable rock features all around. The layout is complex and very confusing in mist. In clearer conditions, the dramatic fang of rock known as the Basteir Tooth stands in front of the cliffs of Am Basteir. Rock climbers can often be seen making their way across the face to the right. To the right of the tooth is the rock peak of Sgùrr a Fionn Choire, which is less fearsome than the Tooth (and can be ascended by keen scramblers).\n\nThe peak to the left is Sgùrr a' Basteir which can be ascended from here as a detour - well worthwhile for the absolutely classic view of Sgùrr nan Gillean and its amazing Pinnacle Ridge. There is some easy scrambling at first as the ridge descends, then easy walking continues along or beside the narrow ridge to the summit of Sgùrr a' Bhasteir. Retrace your steps back to the bealach after making the detour.\n\nTo reach Bruach Na Frithe, follow a path in the scree below Sgùrr a Fionn Choire. The paths keep a little below the ridge line to avoid rocky obstacles, until the ridge becomes easier and the ascent begins.\n\nThere are great views back of Am Basteir and Sgùrr a' Fionn Choire. On the final climb to the summit Bruach na Frithe, the easiest route is to keep left of the low crags.\n\nBruach Na Frithe's shapely summit has a trig point - the only one on the Cuillin ridge - and is 958m high, a Munro. The name means Slope of the Deer Forest. It is situated at a bend in the ridge where here turns south, and has amazing views along the Cuillin in both directions.\n\nThe simplest way back is to return the same way, but it is possible to descend the northwest ridge as an alternative. This ridge is normally regarded as a moderate scramble, but all the difficulties can be avoided by a rough bypass path which is easier to find in descent. This path heads along the left side of the northwest ridge and keeps a little below the crest on steep scree and rough ground (In ascent scramblers will prefer to keep to a series of easy dykes, much closer to the ridge crest and on the same flank). The path passes between a prominent rock and the ridge at one point, looking like a gatepost, before continuing along the line of basalt dykes. Below the steep section, the ridge crest is regained for a final narrow and airy but easy section.\n\nAt the end of the ridge the land falls away more steeply. The worst of any scree can be avoided by sticking to the northern spur rather than the northwest one, to reach a flatter, grassier area. From here it is easy to head down the grassy slope on the right to rejoin the ascent path near where it crossed the stream at the foot of Fionn Choire. Now retrace your outward route back to Sligachan, passing the many lovely pools along the way.",

The Allt Mòr car park is set out amidst some magnificent Scots pines. From the far end of the car park take the clear path that starts between two boulders, by an information board and purple waymarker post. Cross a footbridge over the Allt Mòr, and keep ahead as a path joins in from the right. Ignore more turnings off to both left and right and cross another bridge. Eventually a ford is reached - if needed there is a footbridge accessed a short distance upstream.\n\nBack on the main path, a t-junction is soon reached with the track from Glenmore Lodge. Turn right here, continuing to eventually reach the open ground in the floor of the glen that leads up to the Ryvoan Pass. After about two kilometres, the track comes close to Lochan Uaine, a picturesque sheet of turquoise-green water fringed by Scots Pine trees; it is worth descending the steps on the right to visit the loch shore.\n\nBeyond the loch the track continues its gradual climb, and soon forks. The left branch is the continuation of the old Ryvoan Pass route through Abernethy Forest to Nethy Bridge. Our route is the right fork, signed 'Braemar', which ascends the moor and passes to the right of Loch a'Gharbh-choire. It soon crosses the Allt a'Garbh-choire and reaches the site of Bynack Stable. This corrugated iron hut was never a tempting shelter, but it was finally blown down in 2005 after previously being reprieved of demolition by the RSPB. All that remains is a pleasant patch of grass, an inviting mountain camp spot in fine weather.\n\nCross the Nethy and follow the path which begins to climb the moors beyond. This path is part of the Lairig an Laoigh, a mammoth cross-country trek along an ancient route from Aviemore to Braemar; much less well known than the celebrated Lairig Ghru but perhaps even tougher with a tricky river crossing at Fords of Avon. Keep on this Lairig path as it climbs more steeply before reaching the broad plateau to the north of Bynack More.\n\nHere the path for Bynack More forks off to the right some distance short of the summit of the Lairig. Turn right onto this path which heads directly towards Bynack More. Higher up the path steepens as it tackles the north ridge of Bynack More, winding on the sides of the ridge to avoid the rocky crest.\n\nThe summit is a Munro at 1090 metres, and its location at the northeastern edge of the Cairngorms makes it a superb viewpoint; there is nothing higher to interrupt the view over Moray, from where Bynack More can appear to be the highest of the Cairngorms. The usual and quickest return is the same way.\n\nHowever if energy and time is plentiful, you can continue southwards to visit the Barns of Bynack. These huge granite tors - amongst the largest in the Cairngorms - are not in view from the summit (those are the 'Little Barns'), but a descent to the Little Barns and then a steeper downhill to the east will soon lead to them. From the Barns, it is still quickest to return the same way; another option is to traverse the Top of A'Choinneach - which was once a Munro - and then head southwest to the Saddle between Glen Avon and the headwaters of the Nethy (note that the slopes around the Saddle are particularly notorious for full-depth avalanches in winter). From the Saddle head north into Strath Nethy; a path follows the east side of the stream, with some boggy ground further down, to rejoin the outward route by the bridge.",

    "description": "The walk begins from Cairngorm Mountain car park (charge). The Windy Ridge path from here heads direct for the summit - but avoids the best features of the mountain and is hardly worthy of such a famous summit. The route given here is much longer and has more ups and downs, but enables you to visit the dramatic cliff scenery of the northern corries. Pass to the left of the snow factory (which looks like two stacked storage units), then take the path to the right of the hut, then left at the next junction. The path heads up some steps and bends right across the moor (another path joins from the left). At the next fork (450m from the start), keep to the lower, right hand path - the other path heads up into Coire an t-Sneachda. The path soon crosses the Allt Coire an t-Sneachda with the help of stepping stones and continues across the moor; keep right at the next fork.\n\nCross the next stream, which issues from Coire an Lochain, and continue on the path up onto the wide ridge of Miadan Creag an Leth-choin; ignore the smaller path which cuts across the slope. As height is gained great views open up on the left, across the gulf of Coire an Lochain - with its tiny lochan - to Cairn Lochan. Continue on the path which climbs up towards the col between Lurcher's Crag and the Cairngorm - Macdui plateau; from here there are great views over Sròn na Lairige across the Lairig Ghru.\n\nThe path itself is bound for Ben Macdui by the slopes above the Lairig Ghru; leave it on a fainter trod that leads to steeping stones across a flat boggy area. Beyond this the going becomes slightly steeper as the path climbs up to the east of the Coire an Lochain cliffs, eventually gaining the plateau, with stunning views across towards Cairn Toul and Sgòr an Lochain Uaine.\n\nNow follow the path towards (but safely back from - especially in wtiner) the rim of Coire an Lochain. There are two summit cairns - both close to the vertical plateau edge and with a gully between them; there have been fatal accidents here when there is snow on the ground and visibility is poor. In clear summer conditions however there is no difficulty following the plateau edge to the northeast, with great views down into the corrie. There are famous climbs up these cliffs, such as the classic Savage Slit.\n\nAfter about four hundred metres the path leaves the edge and descends across the slopes, slightly south of east; this is a key turning as the natural line leads out onto the craggy Fiacaill Ridge. The route soon nears the cliffs once more - the corrie below now is the even more celebrated climbing area of Coire an t-Sneachda. Drop to a narrow bealach at 1111m; a path climbs up from the corrie at this point - the 'Goat Track' - it is subject to rockfall and not recommended - whilst the path to Ben Macdui heads off to the right. Continue up the slopes opposite, with dramatic views down into the corrie on the left - rockclimbers can often be seen completing their routes.\n\nContinue to the top of Stob Coire an t-Sneachda; the route continues in the same direction briefly before following the curve of the rim of the cliffs round to the left. The path bypasses the top of the Fiacaill a' Choire Cas ridge on its right side; a ridge descending from here can be used for the descent, but to reach the summit of Cairngorm you need to continue eastwards up the broad stony slopes.\n\nAt the summit there is a fine cairn, and the less inspiring weather station building with a small mast; this is a long way from feeling the wildest of the Munros. Nevertheless, the views are magnificent. The summit has become less crowded in more recent years since passengers on the funicular railway are not allowed to leave the building due to conservation concerns, the old chairlift it replaced used to carry hundreds of ill-equipped visitors close to the summit, and the fragile ecology of the plateau is showing signs of recovery from the damage.\n\nA path leads northwards towards the Ptarmigan station building. The upper section is rough and lined by cairns; further on the path steepens but is pitched and has rope handrails on either side to help limit erosion. The Ptarmigan restaurant is the top station of the funicular railway.\n\nTo continue the walk down, pass to the right of the Ptarmigan building and descend on a broad path signed as the 'Windy Ridge Path'. Keep right at a fork and head across a ski-run (between two snow fences), then keep left beside the second snow fence (ignoring a track straight ahead towards Coire na Ciste). The path is now obvious and the views to Loch Morlich, surrounded by the green carpet of Rothiemurchus Forest remain magnificent. Continue down the broad Sròn an Aonaich ridge; part way down follow the path as it bears left and descends more steeply to reach the track by the funicular just above the bottom station.

The going now becomes stonier underfoot; the summit cairn at 1064m is just on the left side of the wall. Head southwest along the broad ridge, initially beside the stone wall.\n\nSoon it is possible to diverge from the wall to pick up a track just to the left of a tiny lochan. The track west, then southwest, then south, eventually cutting across the east side of Glas Maol. Leave it at a suitable point (there may be a tiny cairn) to ascend directly to reach the large cairn and triangulation pillar atop Glas Maol. At 1068 metres, this is the highest of the day's Munros; the plateau extends for miles to the east and north, eventually merging with Lochnagar.\n\nVery easy but featureless grassy terrain is crossed SW towards a prominent cairn at Bathach Beag. From here a wall is followed southwards along the now better defined ridge. At the bealach there is a tiny stone shelter on the east side of the wall - barely enough to accommodate a sheep! From here the walk acquires more character, and rockier slopes take over on the ascent to Cul Riabhach, and then ascends to the stony summit of Creag Leacach, the lowest but finest of the four Munros at 987 metres.\n\nFrom here there is a choice of routes. Under snow the route we describe crosses a very steep avalanche prone slope on a path which is likely to be banked out - at such times it is better to descend SW from Creag Leachach to the SW Top, then down to the bealach with Meall Gorm before heading NE down to the Allt Coire a' Bhathaich, returning to the start with a tiring road walk over the Cairnwell Pass. In summer though, the quickest and most pleasant option is probably to retrace your steps back to the cairn at Bathach Beag, and then follow an initially very faint, narrow path that contours the west side of Glas Maol - initially across grassy slopes but later across the steep slope.\n\nThis leads out onto the Meall Odhar ridge, where a zig-zag path coming down from the summit of Glas Maol is joined. Follow this to the left to reach the top of the ski tows. From here a track leads down through the upper part of the ski area, reaching a peat-hagged bealach where there are several buildings which are part of the ski centre. Continue on the track down to the top of the Cairnwell Pass. From here it's around 2.5km walk northwards downhill alongside the busy road to the return to the start.",

    "summary": "The magnificent walk from Cairn Toul to Braeriach follows the edge of a vast plateau around the Cairngorms' most spectacular corries. It is also exceptionally remote and arduous; many will break the route with an overnight stay at Corrour bothy. This can be approached either from the Linn of Dee to the south leaving a very long return, or via the Chalamain Gap from the Sugar Bowl car park on Speyside - the latter route making the traverse possible in a single epic day for the extremely fit.",
    "description": "The most convenient start point is the Sugar Bowl car park on the left at the foot of the zig-zags on the Cairngorm ski road (long alternatives which avoid the Chalamain Gap include Whitewell and Loch Morlich). Cross the road and follow the path down to a footbridge over the Allt Mòr in a ravine. On the far side bear right uphill and then back left onto a paved path that keeps to the north of the stream for a couple of kilometres with good views before it dips to cross the now small stream once more. Beyond the path continues, climbing gradually towards the obvious little rocky pass ahead - the Chalamain Gap.\n\nBefore reaching this the path vanishes as the gap is floored by rough, awkward boulders. Progress through the gap is slow and care is needed - this is a potential leg-breaker. The terrain thankfully eases once more on the far side as the path slopes downhill to the south southwest towards the great cleft of the Lairig Ghru. Soon the path descends more steeply down to a burn, joining a path coming up from Rothiemurchus Forest. Turn left here and follow the path which soon crosses the burn at a rocky section.\n\nFollow the path up the glen into the remarkable deep trench of the Lairig Ghru, filled with hummocky morraines left behind by the ice-age. This is Scotland's most famous hill pass, climbing to almost three thousand feet between two of the highest mountains in the land. The great broken cliffs of Lurcher's Crag wall the left side at first, and soon the walls of Sròn na Lairig on the right become just as impressive. At the top of the pass, if the weather is clear, the summits of Cairn Toul and the Devil's Point come into view for the first time. The path is lost as the route continues over several stony morains, passing the Pools of Dee - one of the two sources of the mighty river that flows to Aberdeen. Keep to the left side of the stream on the descent, crossing the foot of the slopes of mighty Ben Macdui, as the branch to the right heads into the great super-corrie of An Garbh Coire.\n\nContinue following the path southwards, with terrific views into Garbh Choire on the right - the great rim of the cliffs far above is the route followed later in the walk. After almost four kilometres from the pools the Clach nan Taillear is reached. The name means the Stone of the Tailors and according to local legend it was behind this rock that a group of tailors died in a blizzard when crossing the Lairig as part of a wager. Follow the path for almost another kilometre before turning right onto a branch path that crosses a bridge over the river Dee to reach lonely Corrour bothy. Unless attempting to complete the walk in a single epic day, this open shelter - or a tent pitched at a good distance from it - is the most likely spot to spend the night. The bothy is maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting.\n\nFrom Corrour bothy, the great rocky boss of the Devil's Point looks formidable. To reach it, take the path that climbs up close by the Allt a 'Choire Odhair into the high corrie. The headwall is ascended by means of a zig-zag path - often blocked by hard snow well into the summer. The climb ends very suddenly as the route emerges onto the wide, spacious bealach beyond. The Devil's Point - so impressive from lower down the glen - is reached easily by a detour to the left from here, with less than a hundred metres of further ascent. Return to the bealach and begin the much longer climb up the wide, windswept slopes to the northwest, reaching the summit of Stob Coire an t-Saighdeir at the very edge of the steep corrie of the same name.\n\nContinue around the rim of the corrie, descending gently before a final steeper climb up a boulderfield to the summit ridge of Cairn Toul. This bouldery summit is the fourth highest in Britain - and the most remote of the four, with an elegant outline from many directions. The views are superb, especially northwest over the great gulf of Coire an Lochain with its fine lochan to the mighty summit of Braeriach. The route turns west here and descends over boulders, this time with the cliffs of Coire an Lochain falling vertically on the right.\n\nAfter crossing a bealach the route climbs again, now on easier terrain, to reach Sgòr an Lochain Uaine - also known as the Angel's Peak. A twin to Cairn Toul, Sgòr an Lochain Uaine was promoted to become a separate Munro in 1997. Its northeast ridge is a fine scramble but our traverse continues along the headwalls of the cliffs, descending to another bealach - with great views looking back - before climbing to Càrn na Criche above the great buttresses of Garbh Choire Mòr .\n\nAt this point the route flattens off into a truly vast plateau. Head east northeast, keeping away from the crags, to reach the second branch of the infant river Dee. Amazingly, at an altitude of 1200 metres, this is already a fast-flowing stream. Cross it and make a bee-line across the featureless plateau towards Braeriach. The summit of this mountain - the highest on the route - is on the very edge of the great gulf of Coire Bhrochain - with perhaps the finest crags on the walk plunging away at one's feet. For this reason it can be very dangerous to navigate towards the cairn in winter conditions in poor visibility - in which case a good distance should be kept from the plateau edge. The views are superb, both over the great forests of Speyside and back across all the corries of the Garbh Choire complex to Cairn Toul, and across the Lairig to Ben Macdui.\n\nContinue along the corrie edge before bearing left and descending to a bealach and then up onto the Sròn na Lairig ridge. Follow the path that descends northwards along this ridge, eventually passing close to the edge of the steep crags that plunge back down to the Lairig Ghru and across to Lurcher's Crag opposite. Continue on the path to the north until it descends to rejoin the Lairig path once the terrain becomes easier. Cross the stream once more and then follow the outward path when it branches right, climbing once more towards the Chalamain Gap. Pass through the gap - a sore trial on the boulders at the end of an epic route - and retrace your steps back to the Sugar Bowl car park.",

    "summary": "Càrn a' Chlamain is the relatively minor stony summit rising above a spacious and very remote plateau. The approach is up scenic Glen Tilt, one of the Highlands' most beautiful glens and it is this that makes the walk a minor classic.",
    "description": "Park at the well-signed car park near the Old Bridge of Tilt. There is a waymarked circuit of Glen Tilt marked with yellow arrows which can be followed for the approach to Càrn a'Chlamain. Begin along this, leaving the car park on the path near the information board through the trees. The path soon heads slightly downhill, then upriver and crosses the road on an old stone footbridge. The path contours around the steep valley side, a wooden hand rail guards the steepest section, and then joins a track where it turns right. Soon there is a short optional loop off to the right to view the Falls of Fender - this soon rejoins the main track.\n\nWhen a plantation is reached on the right hand side, take the path slightly uphill to the left through silver birches (it is quicker but less scenic to continue on the track to a bridge and then along the floor of the glen and it is necessary to go this way if long-range shooting is taking place on the rifle range). After a while the path crosses a stone bridge and climbs uphill to reach another track where you turn right. There are superb views up Glen Tilt from between the trees and soon you reach the entrance to the shooting range where there is a viewpoint with wooden seats just beyond the metal cabin.\n\nThe route crosses the shooting range and for a number of weekends a year access is banned because of long range shooting. These dates can be found from the Atholl Estate's Ranger Service - or in the car park. Continue over the cattle grid and stone bridge and follow the track as it heads downhill across the Range. Keep following the main track, ignoring two tracks to the left. At the bottom keep on the left (the other track leads to Gilbert's bridge). After a while the path crosses a stone bridge over a tributary and continues to a metal gate. Go through the diamond-shaped pedestrian gate to the left and head uphill on the forestry track.\n\nFollow this until a waymarked junction points to a path heading downhill to the right towards the river. This path passes the remains of a settlement and crosses the flat field alongside the River Tilt. At the far end of the field climb to regain the track at a metal gate. Follow the track which becomes grassy and at a junction take the lower path through sparse trees near the river.\n\nCross the Allt Mhairc on a beautiful stone bridge where you can see the bowl shapes and pools carved by the water beneath. Further up the glen cross another stream on stepping stones and soon afterwards it is necessary to detour uphill away from the river bank as a short section of the path has been washed away. Once on top of the grassy bank you can rejoin the path and follow it through widely spaced trees until it reaches Gaw's Bridge. Don't cross but continue up the glen to reach and cross the Allt Craoinidh. On the far side, take the grassy path that climbs off uphill through the heather - this is the steep start of the ascent of the mountain.\n\nThe path reaches a bulldozed track that continues steadily up the broad ridge, taking a wide detour to the right to pass a steeper section at 800m. You can either stay on the track or branch left at a cairn and follow the more direct line of the old path for a long section. Back on the track follow it until it cuts just to the right of the stony dome that is the summit of Càrn a'Chlamain.\n\nLeave the track here on a stony path to complete the final short section of the ascent. The summit cairn of Càrn a'Chlamain is a Munro at 963 metres; the view impresses most with its wildness and feeling of immense space.\n\nReturn by the route of ascent back down to the floor of the glen. Once back in Glen Tilt there are several options for the return. You could simply reverse the route of ascent, or make it a little easier by crossing Gaw's Bridge and then later on Cumhann Leum bridge to return all along the valley floor. The third option is to make a return a little higher on the eastern side of Glen Tilt, as described as the return leg of the Glen Tilt circuit.",

    "description": "Park at the large car park at the end of the public road up Glen Muick; there is a charge. Note that on busy weekends the car park can become full and at such times the road up Glen Muick is closed - so arrive early or plan an alternative. Continue along the track to the Spittal of Glen Muick, where there is a small wooden visitor centre and toilets. Lochnagar is the first peak on this route, so turn up the track to the right here. Follow this across the flat floor of the glen, soon crossing a bridge over the River Muick. At the far side of the glen, fork left onto a path that then meets another track at forestry surrounding the Balmoral Estate's various buildings at Allt-na-guibhsaich. Go straight across on a path up through the woods to gain the track which ascends beside the stream. After just under 1km of uphill the track crosses to the north side of the Allt na Guibhsaich; this is usually easily crossed.\n\nPass above the minor gorge of Clais Rathadan and follow the track round to the right. Further on, take the clear branch path leading off to the left - this is the main path for Lochnagar, and has been improved in recent years by stone-pitching. Follow the path as it climbs towards the bealach or col visible between the main bulk of Lochnagar on the left, and its outlying peak of Meikle Pap. The path passes a memorial to Bill Stuart, a climber who was killed on the cliffs in 1953. As you approach the bealach, the main Lochnagar path diverts off to the left, but it is really worth continuing ahead to the bealach itself.\n\nHere, the massive but domed and stony hills of the walk so far are replaced by a view across Lochnagar's famous northern corrie, a magnificent curve of buttresses cradling a small lochan. If you have the energy, you can divert up to the summit of Meikle Pap on the right for the best views. Rejoin the path for the ascent up the slope on the left, known as the Ladder. This slope is covered with large boulders but the path avoids the worst; in winter this slope is notorious for avalanches. Above the Ladder the slope eases onto a flatter plateau. Follow the edge of the cliffs (not too closely!) round to the right; in good weather you can peer down the gullies to the lochan below.\n\nAs the cliffs curve to the northwest, there is another ascent, and the minor cairn on a boulder at Cac Càrn Mòr is just beyond. Continue to reach the viewpoint indicator on the pointed rocky outcrop at Cac Càrn Beag, the true summit of Lochnagar, which a magnificent viewpoint for Deeside and the Cairngorms massif. Lochnagar was climbed by Queen Victoria, who wrote of the summit 'But alas! Nothing whatever to be seen; and it was cold, and wet, and cheerless.' Hopefully you are luckier!\n\nReturn to the Cac Càrn Mòr but this time follow the path which heads southwest across the plateau. Across a shallow bealach, the path ascends towards the rocky prow of The Stuic, which is worth detouring to for its view down to Loch nan Eun and across the Dee valley. Although The Stuic is the finest prominence on this part of the walk, the Munro summit of the White Mounth is Càrn a'Choire Bhòidheach, which is reached by a detour of about half a kilometre to the south. A local legend says that when all the snows here melt, the day of doom is drawing near - these days the snows melt every summer so perhaps Global warming has been more dramatic than previously thought! Head northwest to regain the old stalkers path, turning left onto it as it descends across the flank of the hill and crosses the Allt an Da Chraobh Bheath.\n\nThe domed hill to the north here is Càrn an t-Sagairt Beag, a humble top; to reach the next Munro, continue on the stalkers path until after it crosses a second stream, and then strike northwest uphill as soon as the going is straightforward. This brings you to the cairns on the summit of Càrn an t-Sagairt Mòr , Munro no.3 at 1047 metres; there are two cairns, with the more southerly being the higher. Just to the north is a large piece of wreckage - a part of an RAF Canberra aircraft which crashed into the hillside here in 1956. There are further fragments of wreckage spread over a wide area of the mountain.\n\nDescend southeast from the cairn to the wide, featureless bealach. This is truly bleak country, and navigation could be difficult in bad weather; the summit of Munro no.4, Cairn Bannoch at 1012 metres, is easier to spot in better conditions, with its cairn atop an outcrop, itself topping a small conical peak. Continue southeast, bypassing Cairn of Gowal, to gain an ever improving path to the final Munro, Broad Cairn. This summit can be avoided on its south side by a stalkers path, but today's bagging generation of walkers have blazed a new path over the summit cairn. This is a better viewpoint, with Loch Muick in view, whilst to the northwest the plateau collapses in the great precipices of Creag an Dubh Loch - a crag which in recent times has approached the popularity of Lochnagar itself.\n\nContinue east from the summit, descending a boulderfield to join a bulldozed track across the plateau. Follow this as it curves southeast before it curves back left to come close to the edge of the steep slopes above Loch Muick. The track runs across the top of these slopes for some distance, giving excellent views of the Loch, before it reaches the end of the plateau and descends in a series of zigzags. Cross the bridge over the Black Burn and continue on the track which still keeps some height above Loch Muick. Pass close to the boathouse near the foot of the loch, and continue straight ahead on the track to return to the Spittal of Glenmuick.",

Begin the walk from the cafe by heading past the main ski building and then turning left across a gravelled yard to join a track climbing steeply uphill. Follow this diagonally to the right to reach a ski-lift and an octagonal cafe building (used in winter only). Continue on the main track between two ski-lifts, climbing steeply uphill. The track then bends left and crosses over a ski-run. Once past the far snow fence turn right onto a slightly narrower, eroded track climbing steeply. This eventually recrosses a ski-run; when it forks take the left branch which aims straight uphill.\n\nThe track climbs to reach the ridge just west of Càrn Aosda (with a Càrn Aosda signpost). Ignore the track cutting across the slope to the right and instead head straight uphill on a stony path to soon reach the summit cairn. At 917 metres in height and with the high level start this is probably the easiest of all Munros to reach. Unfortunately the extensive ski developments badly scar its slopes and detract from the experience, though the views are good.\n\nReturn to the track junction where you first met the summit ridge, and this time continue ahead along the ridge. Follow the track as it passes the top of the ski runs and eventually descends to a bealach above Loch Vrotachan. Here the track swings left and begins to climb once more.\n\nBefore reaching the next minor summit, take a narrow path off to the right to cut across the slopes and reach a second bealach, marked 808m on OS maps. Cross this bealach - with the ski developments now out of sight and mind - and climb the path up the grassy slope beyond. This continues round above the broken crags of Creag a'Choire Dhirich and passes a couple of small lochans before reaching the small plateau Càrn nan Sac.\n\nContinue along the now flater, featureless ridge, beyond which is a final short climb to the cairn. This is Càrn a'Ghèoidh, the highest of the three peaks at 975 metres, and unlike the other two it does have a feeling of remoteness and escape. Glas Tulaichean and its graceful ridges dominate the view to the west.\n\nFrom here, retrace your steps back to the 808m bealach below the Aosda - Cairnwell ridge. From here take the path which climbs opposite onto the ridge and then gain the track just beyond. Turn right up this, soon passing the top of the chairlift.\n\nBeyond is the summit of the Cairnwell, the third Munro at 933 metres and crowned with ugly transmitter masts, buildings and a makeshift shelter. It is worth continuing a little beyond in order to enjoy a grand view down Glen Shee with no distractions.\n\nFrom here the easiest descent is to head back down the ridge track, continuing to the 795m bealach below Carn Aosda and then following a good track to the right which descends the corrie and rejoins the outward route above the octagonal cafe. It is also possible to make a more direct descent nearer to the chairlift, but this is steeper and is over rough and pathless ground.",

    "description": "Park at the large National Trust car park at the Linn of Dee; there is a charge. Before beginning the walk, it is worth heading back to the road crossing to take a path (yellow markers) to view the Linn of Dee, where the River Dee plunges through a narrow rocky defile, spanned by the road bridge. Return to the car park, and this time take the footpath which leaves it to the north. This path through the forest has a 'boardwalk' surface in parts, and soon curves east and passes through a gate to join the main landrover track heading up Glen Lui. Turn left up this track, which soon crosses the Lui Water, leaves the forest and continues up the more empty glen.\n\nAfter a couple more kilometres the track passes below a plantation and then enters the beautiful pinewoods around Derry Lodge. This former shooting lodge is boarded up; it is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland following its purchase of the vast Mar Lodge estate. Just south of here is Bob Scott's, an open refuge for walkers; please help to maintain this by carrying out any rubbish when you pass back this way as it has been badly abused by some. Continue past Derry Lodge, forking right past the rescue hut and crossing the Derry Burn via a footbridge. On the far side turn left. Soon a wide clearing in the pinewoods is reached - the going across this section is boggy. Beyond this the path improves greatly, soon leaving the last pines behind.\n\nWhen the path forks, take the left branch which soon leads through a chicane into an area of fenced, regenerating woodland. Soon a ford over the Luibeg burn is reached; this is often a substantial river. If the water level is low it may be possible to cross it here; if in spate, a detour of around four hundred metres upstream is required. On the far side, a very wet section of path from the bridge rejoins the main path above the ford.\n\nAfter another few hundred metres a clear path, reconstructed in recent years, branches off to the right to begin the ascent proper. The climb continues northwest, pretty directly up the slopes which get steadily steeper, with open ground and stones replacing the heather beside the recently repaired path. Once above the level of the Coire na Poite crags the ground levels off once more and the route bears slightly left to join the south ridge heading up towards Càrn a'Mhaim.\n\nThe first summit at 1014 metres is bypassed to the left side; the true summit is around half a kilometre northwest across a shallow col. The views are excellent, particularly of the Devil's Point and Càrn Toul across the deep trench of the Dee.\n\nThe finest feature of the mountain is the narrowing ridge that continues NNW, becoming a fine arete; it is well worth making a detour along this ridge even if you are going to return the same way afterwards. From the bealach beyond it is possible to continue onto Ben Macdui, via a long climb of four hundred metres up the bouldery shoulder to the south of the Allt Clach nan Tailleir; another option is to descend from the bealach via the Allt Cam a' Mhaim - but this route is pathless and very wet at first.

    "description": "Park at the Linn of Dee car park; there is a charge payable to the National Trust for Scotland. Begin the walk by returning to the Linn of Dee road and turning right towards the bridge. As the road bends left to cross the Dee, continue straight ahead onto the track past the barrier - it is signed as a right of way to places such as Blair Atholl (via Glen Tilt) and Kingussie (via Glen Feshie) - both superb long-distance cross-country walks. The track leads past some fine old granny pines, with the beautiful River Dee on the left. Further on the remains of several old townships can be seen dotted around the glen floor.\n\nAfter just short of 5km a path goes off to the right - destined for Corrour Bothy and a back route through to the Lairig Ghru. Our route continues along the track, crossing White Bridge over the Dee. Further on some plantations on the right - felled in part - do detract from the feeling of wildness, and Glen Geldie lacks some of the attractiveness of Glen Tilt or Glen Feshie to which it can lead. However there is no denying this is truly remote country. When the track forks, take the right branch to keep on the north side of the Geldie towards a building - the more open glen across the Geldie is that of the Bynack Burn (and is the through route to Glen Tilt).\n\nThe building is Ruighe Ealasaid (the Red House) - derelict for many years but since 2022 renovated and open as an MBA bothy for walkers to stay in. Continue up the increasingly bleak Glen Geldie. After passing a plantation the track reaches a ford over the Allt Dhaidh Beag, but there is a footbridge just to the right. Further on the Allt Dhaidh Mòr has no bridge and usually has a substantial volume of water - it may require a wade (or be impossible in high spate). After a further kilometre ignore a track off to the right (the onward route to Glen Feshie) and instead continue down to reach the ford over the River Geldie itself. This usually will involve getting wet feet - and again could be impassable in spate).\n\nAfter crossing another tributary the track leads to its destination - the ruins of Geldie Lodge. Only a small, doorless shed can provide any shelter here. From here follow the very well-maintained stalkers path that continues west - it winds about initially but provides much easier walking than the rough moors around. The path extends further than is shown on many OS maps; follow it as it eventually descends slightly to reach the Allt a'Chaorainn. Cross this burn and head west up onto the moorland. There is a faint path initially but this is soon lost as the route continues across boggy ground before climbing up onto the north ridge of Càrn an Fhidhleir - thankfully now on firmer, stony ground. Head up the ridge to reach the summit cairn - a real prize for any Munro-bagger. Whilst the summit area is quite flat, the views are very extensive.\n\nA surprisingly clear path heads SEE along the ridge. It traverses the left flank on the minor bump of point 906m, though this crosses steep grass and it may be easier to continue over the top before heading steeply down to the bealach to the east, a peat mess at 702m. Continue up the far side, through heather at first before more open ground is reached once more. The large summit cairn of An Sgarsoch is a short distance beyond a rocky outcrop, and has good views of the main Cairngorms range.\n\nDescend northwards. There is a short steeper section part way down, but otherwise wide open slopes lead towards the bealach with Sgarsoch Bheag. A path avoids this hillock on the west side, eventually swinging round to the right before petering out. Continue northwards to rejoin the excellent stalkers path used on the approach, and turn right to begin the long walk back to the Linn of Dee.\n\nThe return retraces the outward route. The river crossings seem even more tiring on the long march back, passing the old cottage near the Geldie/Bynack junction and then White Bridge before the final section above the Dee.",

    "description": "There is a parking area at the start of the private drive to the Dalmunzie Castle Hotel. The first two kilometres of the walk is along the drive to the hotel itself; alternatively the walk can be shortened by paying to park at the hotel itself by calling at reception. The hotel is a magnificent baronial mansion; on reaching it continue on the track which passes it to the right and leads towards Glenlochsie Farm. Use the detour to bypass the farmyard using marker posts through the field on the left, soon rejoining the track west up Glen Lochsie. The track crosses the river at NO079717 - if the river is low you can remain on the track which crosses back again later. Alternatively the crossings can be avoided by following a sharp zig-zag to the right and then back left at a higher level.\n\nThis is the line of an old railway which was built to bring down stone for extensions to Dalmunzie Castle in 1921. The line remained in use for sporting guests up until the 1970s and there are still some old concrete sleepers along the way as well as a bridge over a substantial burn coming down the hillside. A second burn has had its bridge washed away and must be forded. Just beyond this, above the ruins of Glenlochsie Lodge, the bulldozed track joins back in from the left. Follow this track as it winds up the slope onto the broad ridge of Breac-reidh.\n\nThe track continues right up onto the dome of Glas Tulaichean, detracting greatly from the feeling of being out in the hills, but the views are extensive. At its highest point leave the main track and head to the right for a short distance to reach the summit, passing a small cairn before reaching the trig point marking the Munro summit. In clear conditions there are good views down into the craggier ground of the Ghlas Choire just to the east.\n\nDescend northeast at first around the rim of this corrie, then at the shoulder aim north to keep to the left of another corrie - Glas Choire Bheag - and avoid descending the ridge between them.\n\nWhen the boggy ground beneath Mam nan Càrn comes into view ahead aim northwest on the final steeper descent to pick up a stalkers path across the boggier slopes just on the far side of the bealach. Follow this path to the 771 metre bealach beneath Càrn an Rìgh. From here leave the path to tackle the slopes opposite; the ascent is made less steep by keeping a little to the left at first before the final more direct climb to the summit across short grass and stones. Càrn an Rìgh may be the lower of the two peaks at 1029 metres but it is in the heart of some truly wild country, and has a fine view of Beinn a'Ghlò to the west.\n\nRetrace your steps to the bealach and along the stalkers path below Mam nan Carn. This peters out into a bog, but soon appears again, aiming for the south side of Loch nan Eun. The loch is surprisingly extensive, a lonely and atmopheric place at almost 800m.\n\nFrom here there is a good view down the length of Gleann Taitneach, the route of descent. Keep to the left of the stream down the first steep section, using a boggy path. A bulldozed track can then be picked up after about a kilometre and a half. This fords the Allt Elrig side stream to continue down the glen.\n\nThe steep-sided glen gives a long but pleasant walk back towards Dalmunzie. Leave the track at NO089723 to cross a recently rebuilt footbridge over the Allt Ghlinn Thaitneach. Once across, follow a path down the west bank; this rejoins the outward route close to the Dalmunzie Hotel. When the track is reached turn left to return to the hotel and back along the drive to the start.",

    "summary": "A long hillwalk taking in the five Munros on the extensive White Mounth plateau. Lochnagar is by far the finest of the summits, but in good weather this is all a hugely enjoyable round with a great feeling of space.",
    "description": "Park at the large car park at the end of the public road up Glen Muick; there is a charge. Note that on busy weekends the car park can become full and at such times the road up Glen Muick is closed - so arrive early or plan an alternative. Continue along the track to the Spittal of Glen Muick, where there is a small wooden visitor centre and toilets. Lochnagar is the first peak on this route, so turn up the track to the right here. Follow this across the flat floor of the glen, soon crossing a bridge over the River Muick. At the far side of the glen, fork left onto a path that then meets another track at forestry surrounding the Balmoral Estate's various buildings at Allt-na-guibhsaich. Go straight across on a path up through the woods to gain the track which ascends beside the stream. After just under 1km of uphill the track crosses to the north side of the Allt na Guibhsaich; this is usually easily crossed.\n\nPass above the minor gorge of Clais Rathadan and follow the track round to the right. Further on, take the clear branch path leading off to the left - this is the main path for Lochnagar, and has been improved in recent years by stone-pitching. Follow the path as it climbs towards the bealach or col visible between the main bulk of Lochnagar on the left, and its outlying peak of Meikle Pap. The path passes a memorial to Bill Stuart, a climber who was killed on the cliffs in 1953. As you approach the bealach, the main Lochnagar path diverts off to the left, but it is really worth continuing ahead to the bealach itself.\n\nHere, the massive but domed and stony hills of the walk so far are replaced by a view across Lochnagar's famous northern corrie, a magnificent curve of buttresses cradling a small lochan. If you have the energy, you can divert up to the summit of Meikle Pap on the right for the best views. Rejoin the path for the ascent up the slope on the left, known as the Ladder. This slope is covered with large boulders but the path avoids the worst; in winter this slope is notorious for avalanches. Above the Ladder the slope eases onto a flatter plateau. Follow the edge of the cliffs (not too closely!) round to the right; in good weather you can peer down the gullies to the lochan below.\n\nAs the cliffs curve to the northwest, there is another ascent, and the minor cairn on a boulder at Cac Càrn Mòr is just beyond. Continue to reach the viewpoint indicator on the pointed rocky outcrop at Cac Càrn Beag, the true summit of Lochnagar, which a magnificent viewpoint for Deeside and the Cairngorms massif. Lochnagar was climbed by Queen Victoria, who wrote of the summit 'But alas! Nothing whatever to be seen; and it was cold, and wet, and cheerless.' Hopefully you are luckier!\n\nReturn to the Cac Càrn Mòr but this time follow the path which heads southwest across the plateau. Across a shallow bealach, the path ascends towards the rocky prow of The Stuic, which is worth detouring to for its view down to Loch nan Eun and across the Dee valley. Although The Stuic is the finest prominence on this part of the walk, the Munro summit of the White Mounth is Càrn a'Choire Bhòidheach, which is reached by a detour of about half a kilometre to the south. A local legend says that when all the snows here melt, the day of doom is drawing near - these days the snows melt every summer so perhaps Global warming has been more dramatic than previously thought! Head northwest to regain the old stalkers path, turning left onto it as it descends across the flank of the hill and crosses the Allt an Da Chraobh Bheath.\n\nThe domed hill to the north here is Càrn an t-Sagairt Beag, a humble top; to reach the next Munro, continue on the stalkers path until after it crosses a second stream, and then strike northwest uphill as soon as the going is straightforward. This brings you to the cairns on the summit of Càrn an t-Sagairt Mòr , Munro no.3 at 1047 metres; there are two cairns, with the more southerly being the higher. Just to the north is a large piece of wreckage - a part of an RAF Canberra aircraft which crashed into the hillside here in 1956. There are further fragments of wreckage spread over a wide area of the mountain.\n\nDescend southeast from the cairn to the wide, featureless bealach. This is truly bleak country, and navigation could be difficult in bad weather; the summit of Munro no.4, Cairn Bannoch at 1012 metres, is easier to spot in better conditions, with its cairn atop an outcrop, itself topping a small conical peak. Continue southeast, bypassing Cairn of Gowal, to gain an ever improving path to the final Munro, Broad Cairn. This summit can be avoided on its south side by a stalkers path, but today's bagging generation of walkers have blazed a new path over the summit cairn. This is a better viewpoint, with Loch Muick in view, whilst to the northwest the plateau collapses in the great precipices of Creag an Dubh Loch - a crag which in recent times has approached the popularity of Lochnagar itself.\n\nContinue east from the summit, descending a boulderfield to join a bulldozed track across the plateau. Follow this as it curves southeast before it curves back left to come close to the edge of the steep slopes above Loch Muick. The track runs across the top of these slopes for some distance, giving excellent views of the Loch, before it reaches the end of the plateau and descends in a series of zigzags. Cross the bridge over the Black Burn and continue on the track which still keeps some height above Loch Muick. Pass close to the boathouse near the foot of the loch, and continue straight ahead on the track to return to the Spittal of Glenmuick.",

    "description": "Park at the layby on the east side of the A93, about two kilometres north of the Glenshee Ski Centre. Do not head for the arched wooden bridge, instead following a rougher path down to the grass-covered old stone bridge which was once part of the military road from Perth to Braemar. Soon the route becomes simply a path, but the going also becomes a little drier underfoot. The path is hard to follow in parts, passing two sets of old shielings.\n\nAfter the second set of shielings the path reaches a tributary burn; head up beside this briefly before finding a good crossing place. A rough path now continues towards the stony dome of Càrn an Tuirc. The climb is initially through grass and heather, and then the path peters out in a boggy section. Higher up, it is possible to avoid most of the stones. There are great views back towards the Cairnwell Pass.\n\nThe summit cairn and adjacent small shelter cairn sit together on the flat plateau at 1019 metres; this first of the day's Munros has a great feeling of space though the plateau robs the panorama of much depth; the Cairngorms look fine across Deeside. Head east towards a subsidary cairn then ESE, descending gently to reach a grassy track.\n\nIf the weather is good, it is worth diverting to try to get a view down into Coire Loch Kander, a classic mountain corrie in total contrast to the plateau. Otherwise, to continue the walk, follow the grassy track SSE towards Cairn of Claise, initially across truly featureless grassy terrain. Eventually the track fades out near the end of a drystone wall on the right - follow the wall, which marks the old county boundary. The going now becomes stonier underfoot; the summit cairn at 1064m is just on the left side of the wall. Head southwest along the broad ridge, initially beside the stone wall.\n\nSoon it is possible to diverge from the wall to pick up a track just to the left of a tiny lochan. The track west, then southwest, then south, eventually cutting across the east side of Glas Maol. Leave it at a suitable point (there may be a tiny cairn) to ascend directly to reach the large cairn and triangulation pillar atop Glas Maol. At 1068 metres, this is the highest of the day's Munros; the plateau extends for miles to the east and north, eventually merging with Lochnagar.\n\nVery easy but featureless grassy terrain is crossed SW towards a prominent cairn at Bathach Beag. From here a wall is followed southwards along the now better defined ridge. At the bealach there is a tiny stone shelter on the east side of the wall - barely enough to accommodate a sheep! From here the walk acquires more character, and rockier slopes take over on the ascent to Cul Riabhach, and then ascends to the stony summit of Creag Leacach, the lowest but finest of the four Munros at 987 metres.\n\nFrom here there is a choice of routes. Under snow the route we describe crosses a very steep avalanche prone slope on a path which is likely to be banked out - at such times it is better to descend SW from Creag Leachach to the SW Top, then down to the bealach with Meall Gorm before heading NE down to the Allt Coire a' Bhathaich, returning to the start with a tiring road walk over the Cairnwell Pass. In summer though, the quickest and most pleasant option is probably to retrace your steps back to the cairn at Bathach Beag, and then follow an initially very faint, narrow path that contours the west side of Glas Maol - initially across grassy slopes but later across the steep slope.\n\nThis leads out onto the Meall Odhar ridge, where a zig-zag path coming down from the summit of Glas Maol is joined. Follow this to the left to reach the top of the ski tows. From here a track leads down through the upper part of the ski area, reaching a peat-hagged bealach where there are several buildings which are part of the ski centre. Continue on the track down to the top of the Cairnwell Pass. From here it's around 2.5km walk northwards downhill alongside the busy road to the return to the start.",

    "description": "Park at the Glenshee Ski Centre; there is a car park by the cafe on the west side of the road, and a much larger parking area on the east side for use in the skiing season, there is a charge. Begin the walk from the cafe by heading past the main ski building and then turning left across a gravelled yard to join a track climbing steeply uphill. Follow this diagonally to the right to reach a ski-lift and an octagonal cafe building (used in winter only). Continue on the main track between two ski-lifts, climbing steeply uphill. The track then bends left and crosses over a ski-run. Once past the far snow fence turn right onto a slightly narrower, eroded track climbing steeply. This eventually recrosses a ski-run; when it forks take the left branch which aims straight uphill.\n\nThe track climbs to reach the ridge just west of Càrn Aosda (with a Càrn Aosda signpost). Ignore the track cutting across the slope to the right and instead head straight uphill on a stony path to soon reach the summit cairn. At 917 metres in height and with the high level start this is probably the easiest of all Munros to reach. Unfortunately the extensive ski developments badly scar its slopes and detract from the experience, though the views are good.\n\nReturn to the track junction where you first met the summit ridge, and this time continue ahead along the ridge. Follow the track as it passes the top of the ski runs and eventually descends to a bealach above Loch Vrotachan. Here the track swings left and begins to climb once more.\n\nBefore reaching the next minor summit, take a narrow path off to the right to cut across the slopes and reach a second bealach, marked 808m on OS maps. Cross this bealach - with the ski developments now out of sight and mind - and climb the path up the grassy slope beyond. This continues round above the broken crags of Creag a'Choire Dhirich and passes a couple of small lochans before reaching the small plateau Càrn nan Sac.\n\nContinue along the now flater, featureless ridge, beyond which is a final short climb to the cairn. This is Càrn a'Ghèoidh, the highest of the three peaks at 975 metres, and unlike the other two it does have a feeling of remoteness and escape. Glas Tulaichean and its graceful ridges dominate the view to the west.\n\nFrom here, retrace your steps back to the 808m bealach below the Aosda - Cairnwell ridge. From here take the path which climbs opposite onto the ridge and then gain the track just beyond. Turn right up this, soon passing the top of the chairlift.\n\nBeyond is the summit of the Cairnwell, the third Munro at 933 metres and crowned with ugly transmitter masts, buildings and a makeshift shelter. It is worth continuing a little beyond in order to enjoy a grand view down Glen Shee with no distractions.\n\nFrom here the easiest descent is to head back down the ridge track, continuing to the 795m bealach below Carn Aosda and then following a good track to the right which descends the corrie and rejoins the outward route above the octagonal cafe. It is also possible to make a more direct descent nearer to the chairlift, but this is steeper and is over rough and pathless ground.",

    "description": "There is a small car park in Inverey. This remote community was the last place in eastern Scotland where Gaelic was spoken, in the 1930s; it is split by the Ey burn; the east side (Meikle Inverey) was Protestant whilst the west (Little Inverey) was Catholic. Begin the walk along the track from Meikle Inverey which heads southwest, soon passing a grand house and then through a gate to approach the Ey burn. After a kilometre both the burn and the track fork; take the left branch, which soon crosses the Ey and then zigzags uphill before continuing up the right hand side of the glen.\n\nDown to the left by the burn is an overhanging rock and gorge (now partly collapsed); this sheltered the Colonel's Bed. In the 17th Century a colonel, outlawed for the murder of a Laird, made this his refuge, and was brought food each day by his lover; it requires only a short detour but take care as the rock edges are loose and slippery. Further on are the scant ruins of Auchelie, an abandoned farm. The track then runs closer to the burn once more; on the far side can be seen the Piper's Wood, which has been fenced as an experiment in regeneration.\n\nBeyond, the track crosses the burn once more on another bridge, before crossing back after another two and a half kilometres; there is a view of Beinn Iutharn Mhòr ahead. The track ends at Altanour Lodge, the sad, roofless ruin of and old shooting lodge, still sheltered amongst its trees and with beautiful grassy pastures. If using a mountain bike, this is the best place to leave it. Continue by churned-up tyre tracks up the glen for another four hundred metres, keeping right at a fork.\n\nA maze of muddy tracks and paths leads on up the glen, eventually crossing the Alltan Odhar and then climbing the ill-defined ridge between it and the Allt nan Clach Geala; at the flattening there are a series of grouse butts. Continue NW and then eventually N, leaving the wet ground beyond for the final short pull to reach the cairn on the stony top of Càrn Bhac, a rather shapeless Munro but offering a grandstand view of the southern Cairngorms.\n\nFollow the ridge towards to the 920m top (marked as Càrn an Rìgh on 1:50k maps) before breaking off and descending southwards down wet ground. Extensive peat hags have to be crossed on the 789m bealach; beyond this a slight rise leads to a second descent to a lower bealach. Beyond this the ground increasingly steepens towards the very steep flank of Beinn Iutharn Mhor. Most of this slope is covered with loose scree; in summer there are traces of a path towards the left side.\n\nThe northeastern end of the summit ridge will be reached with some relief. Turn right and follow the graceful curve of the pebbly ridge as it swings left and then right round to the large cairn marking the true summit of Beinn Iutharn Mhòr at 1045 metres\n\nFollow the ridge back northeast and then continue down it as it curves back to the east. Further down there is a steep section before the bleak lower moorland is reached once more. The going now becomes rough once more; either keep to the height of the land or follow very rough paths above the W side of the Allt Beinn Iutharn.\n\nThere is a bridge over the Alltan Odhar, not marked on OS maps, before Altanour Lodge is again reached.

    "description": "Catch a train to Corrour Station. The remotest stop on the UK rail network, it isn't accessible by road. The large building here - once a hostel - is now a cafe / restaurant. Begin the walk along the vehicle track across the moor to the east. When the track forks, keep right, with the tiny Loch Ossian Youth Hostel visible at the shore of the loch. The hostel - which is a superb place to stay - can be visited by a short detour to the left at the next cross roads. Otherwise turn right at this crossroads and then left onto a newly repaired path.\n\nThis path was once part of the famous 'Road to the Isles' and, in this direction, leads eventually to Rannoch Station. It runs parallel to the track by Loch Ossian but at a higher level, and gradually gains more height, becoming very boggy as it crosses the flat ground east of Meall na Lice. It meets another path at a junction by Peter's Stone - a boulder with a plaque attached in memory of Peter Trowell. From here leave the paths behind and head directly up the open slope to the east up wet moorland to reach Meall na Letire Duibhe.\n\nFrom here follow the broad, bumpy shoulder around Coire Creagach to reach the handsome cairn that marks the summit of Càrn Dearg. Though it is lower than many of the mountains around, this is still a fine viewpoint. The start of the ridge which leads down to the Mam Ban is not immediately obvious, though the grassy cone of Sgòr Ghaibhre and its twin Top, Sgòr Choinnich, point the way on a clear day. There is a small intervening bump and one steeper section before the boggy bealach is reached.\n\nThe path from the Mam Ban up Sgòr Gaibhre is much clearer, and leads directly up to the summit; though the higher of the two Munros Sgòr Gaibhre has a much smaller cairn. The eastern side of the mountain is much steeper and craggier than the west, and the massive bulk of Ben Alder looms is this direction. Also easy to identify is Schiehallion - looking very fine and pointy from here.\n\nSome care is needed in poor visibility on the descent to the Bealach nan Sgòr as there is steep ground on the east side - be sure to head northwest initially. From the bealach almost equally steep slopes lead up to Sgòr Choinnich - a twin to Sgòr Gaibhre but only a Top. You can avoid the ascent to the summit of this by making a rising traverse to the left from the bealach. Either way, cross gentle slopes to cross Meall Nathrach Mòr , and continue down the pathless heather towards the foot of Loch Ossian. Keep to the right of the plantations; there is a gate in the fence across the slope beside a burn.\n\nCross boggy ground - keeping just right of a felled area - to reach a clear path, and turn left along this, crossing a bridge, to reach the head of Loch Ossian beside Corrour Lodge. Turn left along the track, crossing a bridge, to begin the walk back along the track to Corrour Station (or Loch Ossian SYHA). There are better views looking back to the lodge - a striking modern building which was completed in 2001 and replaced the original lodge which burnt down in 1942.\n\nKeep right at a fork to bypass the older estate buildings. The track leads through forestry - enlivened by rhododendron blooms in spring - with occasional breaks giving good views over Loch Ossian. Eventually the conifers give way to more natural birches and finally open ground before a junction is reached with the Loch Ossian SYHA over to the right.

Culra bothy is closed due to the presence of asbestos so it is necessary to carry a tent and camp nearby. From Culra a faint path starts up the slope to the west towards Càrn Dearg, soon petering out. Continue up the steep heather slopes to the northwest; the going can be eased slightly by following the line of a grassy gully which is usually dry. When the slope eases, continue across rough ground until curving left to gain the ridge leading up towards Càrn Dearg, which gives much better going.\n\nThe summit of Càrn Dearg has fine views, with Ben Alder and its Leachas ridges having pride of place. Descend west; the ground soon becomes grassy as the route continues across a bealach and crosses the minor Top of An Diollaid. The ridge then descends to a second, lower bealach with some fine scenery.\n\nTo the right Coire Cheap with a circular lochan, whilst on the left the larger Loch an Sgoir is cradled by the spectacular Lancet Edge, whilst the route continues up steep Aisre Ghobhainn, with a path avoiding any problems. It emerges suddenly on a spacious, undulating grassy plateau. In poor conditions it could be difficult to locate the summit, which is marked by a small cairn around a kilometre WSW. From here, it is possible to shorten the walk, either by heading for the Lancet Edge for an exposed scrambly descent, or by heading for the Bealach Dubh.\n\nTo continue the walk to the next two Munros, follow the edge of the plateau WSW; it soon narrows and becomes an obvious ridge as it leads on to a high bealach at 1016 metres. The ascent to dome-like summit of Aonach Beag is short and straightforward; again the summit is marked by a small cairn.\n\nFollow the southwest ridge easily down to the next bealach. The descent route back for Culra leaves from here, but before taking it there is still Beinn Èibhinn to ascent. The first part of this climb is a little steeper, with some rocks, but there are no difficulties. After a slight dip the ridge rises more gently to the first of two summits, marked with the same height on OS 1:25 000 mapping; the second of them is regarded as the Munro, the fourth of the day.\n\nReturn back down the ridge to the last bealach. From here a faint path angles south to avoid some scree to reach grassier ground. Descend into Coire a'Charra Bhig, crossing and then keeping to the left of the stream. Before the bogs at the foot of the corrie are reached traverse the rough slopes to the left, keeping below the crags of Sròn Ruadh but above the peat. Once beyond the bogs drop down to the Allt Coire a'Laobhair and head for the stalkers path a short distance up the far slope. This is superbly maintained; turn left and follow it as it climbs over the Bealach Dubh.

    "summary": "This long hillwalk includes ascents of three of the four Monadh Liath Munros. The hills themselves are undistinguished (particularly Càrn Sgulain), but Càrn Dearg has a feeling of remoteness and the long trek across the plateau from this peak to the others gives a feeling of great space, given favourable weather.",
    "description": "Park at the end of the minor road leading from Newtonmore into Glen Banchor. This is an attractive, surprisingly wild little glen given its position close to the town. Continue on foot along the track up the glen, almost immediately crossing the bridge over the Allt a Chaorainn. The track leads past a plantation and passes close to the site of a deserted township. Just before the house and bridge over the Allt Fionndrigh, take the track which bends off to the right. This leads up into Gleann Fiondrigh, which lacks the open aspect of Glen Banchor, being hemmed in by the foothills of the Monadhliath.\n\nContinue on the track up Gleann Fionndrigh until peters out into a boggy ATV track. Bear left from here to head down to a footbridge over the Allt Fhionndrigh. Follow the ATV track as it now heads southwest up towards a featureless bealach above the west side of the glen, becoming very boggy underfoot. On the wide bealach the route forks - ATV tracks swing both left and uphill to the right. Take the latter, then fork left part way up the slope.\n\nThe very boggy ATV tracks (which may not always be distinct) come closer to the Allt Ballach in upper Gleann Ballach, before rising gently up the eastern side of the glen. The summit of Càrn Dearg rises impressively atop a crag on the opposite side of the glen. As the head of Gleann Ballach is reached the route peters out towards the boggy bowl at the head of the glen.\n\nHere a wide grassy ramp enables an easier climb to the southwest, avoiding coming close to any crags. As height is gained the going becomes dry at last, and an improving path heads up onto the ridge a short distance north of the summit of Càrn Dearg. Continue along the edge to reach the summit cairn, which at 945 metres is the highest of the Monadhliath; the position of the cairn on the edge of the steep drop to Gleann Ballach ensures it is also the finest peak of the range.\n\nRetrace your steps briefly but then continue northwards onto the stony ground around the summit of Càrn Ban. North and west from here stretches the vast, empty and almost featureless plateau of the Monadhliath, as little visited as any ground in Britain. Our onward route is generally northeast, passing over the top of Càrn Ballach and then reaching Meall na Creughaich; all the time the ground underfoot becomes less stony and boggier. Another three kilometres from here, now heading eastwards, is Càrn Sgulain, the second of the day's Munros, and one of the most featureless on Sir Hugh's list.\n\nFinding the route all across the plateau from Càrn Ban to this Munro would be difficult indeed in bad visibility but a line of old metal fenceposts offers guidance. There is little to detain you on Càrn Sgulain's summit, which could be either a small cairn or a larger one slightly further on, so return a short distance southwest to the last bealach, then bearing south-southwest to cross the Allt Cuil na Caillich.\n\nThis stream has cut a steep little 'v'-shaped valley into the plateau, so heading this way is necessary to avoid the steepest drop down to it. Once across the stream and above the steep bank beyond, continue easily southeast to the third Munro, A'Chailleach.\n\nThis is a popular destination in its own right for walkers staying at Newtonmore, and the summit is marked by a huge cairn (visible for miles around across Badenoch), with a windshelter set into one side. The descent route has the benefit of a rough path for much of the way. Begin by heading south; the ascent eventually becomes more gradually and crosses a boggy area. Eventually it descends southeast near a burn into the glen, with great views down towards Newtonmore.\n\nThree-quarters of the way down you'll pass a little corrugated iron hut which offers very rough shelter on a wild day. Further down it is necessary to cross the Allt a'Chaorainn to reach a better path on the far side; this is usually possible using stones and boulders unless in spate (there's a footbridge a short distance downstream). Follow the path down the far side, which almost immediately becomes a track. This leads directly down the glen, passing the forestry plantations at its foot to return directly to the start.",

    "summary": "Càrn Eige and Mam Sodhail are the two highest mountains north of the Great Glen and spectacular viewpoints. This long, wild mountain walk around a horse-shoe of ridges becomes something of an epic by the (optional) addition of the very remote Munro of Beinn Fhionnlaidh.",
    "description": "There's a car park around 200m east of Chisholm Bridge near the head of Loch Beinn a'Mheadhoin. From here a constructed path heads into the woods, soon joining the hydro track up the east side of the Abhainn Gleann nam Fiadh; turn right up this. At first it passes near a plantation, but wilder country is soon reached with the Munros of Toll Creagach and the more impressive Tom a'Chòinich ahead. The track curves to the left through a scattered pinewood. After passing a hydro dam the route becomes a rough path and is can be very boggy in places, and crosses several streams. The Allt Toll Easa can be impassable in high spate but is usually straightforward. A path goes off right immediately afterwards - stay on the boggy path up the glen instead.\n\nThe cone-like peak of Sròn Garbh further up the glen is the first objective. Continue up the glen for a couple more kilometres until below Coire Mhic Fhearchair. When the path forks, take the higher path to the right which leaves the main stream. It is indistinct where it crosses the Allt Coire Mhic Fhearchair - if you lose the path, you are aiming for the grassy shoulder directly ahead. Further up the path is much clearer as it zig-zags up to the hanging plateau below the Garbh-bealach. Continue up the easy grassy ground all the way to the bealach between Sròn Garbh and An Leth-chreag, where a sudden view of Loch Mullardoch and its own range of Munros comes into view.\n\nTurn left at the bealach for the final steep rocky ascent to Sròn Garbh. There is a loose path to the left but if you follow the crest of the ridge you should be able to ascend an amazing man-made rock-staircase, the remains of an old stalking path. This leads up to the flatter ground at the Top of Sròn Garbh - and a grand ridgewalk now stretches ahead. The ridge is straightforward at first but after Stob Coire Dhomhnuill it is riven into a series of jagged, broken pinnacles. Keen scramblers will attempt to traverse them, but there is a bypass path initially on the right and soon switching across to the left side. Beyond there is a slight ascent to Stob a'Choire Dhomhain before a wide bealach and the final climb up to Càrn Eige.\n\nThis summit, marked by a trig point inside a wind-shelter cairn, is 1183 metres, making it the highest mountain north of the Great Glen. The views are extremely extensive, stretching from Skye in the west to the Moray Firth and Ben Rinnes in the east. At this point a decision must be made whether to include Beinn Fhionnlaidh in the day. This involves the loss of a great deal of height and an eventual reascent but Beinn Fhionnlaidh is very difficult to reach from anywhere else so most Munro-baggers will want to go for it. Descend the northwest ridge, which mostly has a good path.\n\nA stony section of the descent is avoided by keeping to the path near the ridge crest. The path then traverses to the left of Stob Coire Lochan before descending once more to the wide Bealach Beag at 832 metres. From here the path heads directly up the steep grassy slope to the north towards Beinn Fhionnlaidh, with the final section being an enjoyable easy ridge. Beinn Fhionnlaidh is one of the most prized Munro summits due to its remoteness, and has great views both along Loch Mullardoch and looking back to Càrn Eige over the large Coire Lochain.\n\nReturn to the bealach and reascend most of the way back up Càrn Eige. At around 1040 metres there is a flatter shoulder; from here it is possible to traverse across the west side of Càrn Eige to avoid the need to return all the way to the summit. There are traces of a path keeping just below the initial areas of loose stones; continue to contour the slope, rising just slightly and finally crossing a couple of areas of stones before emerging back on the ridge at the bealach between Càrn Eige and Mam Sodhail. If unsure of the ground or the navigation it may be easier to stick with the ridge over Càrn Eige instead. From the bealach a path climbs southwards, finally zig-zagging before reaching the massive cairn on the top of Mam Sodhail. The cairn is hollow but the inside can only be reached by climbing it; it was built by the Ordnance Survey and used as the principal triangulation point for northern Scotland.\n\nAs that suggests, the views are as extensive as those from Càrn Eige. In poor weather, you could escape from the ridges from here by descending the southwest ridge and then following the zig-zag path down the headwall of Coire Leachavie. The upper parts of the corrie are very boggy but further down is a stalkers path that leads to the main Loch Affric path and the long walk out. In good conditions, however, it is more enjoyable to along the long ESE ridge towards Mullach Cadha Rainich. The ridge is narrow but grassy and gives a very enjoyable traverse. There is only a very slight ascent over the Top of Mullach Catha Rainich. Beyond there is a longer but gradual ascent to the terminal peak of Sgùrr na Lapaich along the edge of a curious landslip.\n\nThis summit, not be be confused with the Mullardoch Sgùrr na Lapaich further north, was once a Munro before being demoted to the status of a Top; many walkers feel it deserves Munro status and it could become one again in the future. The views may be less far-reaching than those earlier in the day, but they are more beautiful, with wonderful aerial panoramas over Glen Affric, its forests and lochs. Descend the SE ridge, which is steep and rocky though a path avoids any need for scrambling. Once down to the level of the moors, head east to meet a track at a prominent bend. Head down the track which leads to the shores of Loch Affric below Affric Lodge. Turn left along the main track to reach the car park at the end of the road. A further mile down the tarmac road is Chisholm Bridge and the start.",

    "description": "There is a large rough parking area off the south side of the A87 at Lundie (there are no buildings). These mountains are very foreshortened from here, only really appearing full height from much further down towards Glen Moriston. Start the walk by crossing the current A87 road and walking up an old section of the main road on the other side. After a short distance, turn left up a worn, stony track, signed for Càrn Ghluasaid. This follows the line of the old military road and heads up - with good views back - and through a gate before climbing to the right of a transmitter mast. Just beyond this it forks; the old military road contours the hillside, but our route follows the now more obvious hill path to the right, climbing the hillside.\n\nThis old stalkers path used for the ascent is a real delight, being well-graded and mostly dry underfoot. It climbs up to reach a flatter shoulder at An Cruachan, and later crosses some large rocky slabs across which the route is marked with rocks. Further on the path begins climbing again, tackling the steep slope on the left of Coire nan Clach in a series of sharp zigzags. Above this section the west ridge of Càrn Ghluasaid is joined and is enjoyable to follow. Eventually a flattish, bouldery plateau is reached.\n\nThere is a tiny cairn marking the highest point of Càrn Ghluasaid, but another cairn a few metres away has the finest position, situated on the northern edge of the plateau with steep cliffs falling immediately beyond. This rather insignificant summit is a Munro. Continue the walk, keeping the impressive cliffs of the corrie on your right. There is only a short descent before a longer climb leads up to the top of Creag a'Chaorainn; the path veers left to bypass the summit of this minor top.\n\nThere is a very slight descent to the very stony Creag Bealach before the ridge turns towards the north and climbs much more steeply towards the quite graceful summit dome of Sgùrr nan Conbhairean.\n\nThis massive Munro has a suitably large summit cairn and is one of the giants of the area at 1110 metres. It gives very extensive views, particularly impressive looking east over the corries. Go northwest for a short distance, still keeping the steeper cliffs on your right.\n\nFollow the now well defined ridge northwards, with grand views down to the crags and corries to the right, and the regenerating forest of Gleann na Cìche to the left. Once at the bealach, there is only short rise to the first and seemingly insignificant summit of Sàil Chaorainn; though a minor bump this is the third Munro of the day at 1002 metres, just a metre higher than the remoter north top. Return to the bealach below Sgùrr nan Conbhairean. It isn't necessary to climb all the way back over the summit; at the foot of the summit cone a small cairn marks a path which traverses below the summit to the west.\n\nDescend the southwest ridge, which is initially broad but soon narrows to a fine arête with the Gorm Lochan down to the left and Toll Easach to the right. The ridge rises ahead to Drochaid an Tuill Easaich; it isn't necessary to head right up to this summit as a path cuts across its left flank to gain its south ridge.\n\nHead along this ridge, making an initially excellent descent, with good views of Coire Làir on the left. Much lower down the ridge becomes indistinct around Meall Breac; descend southeast and then east down rough, tussocky and in places steep ground towards the Allt Coire nan Clach. If possible cross this burn above its ravine to pick up traces of a path down the east side.\n\nThe path improves as descent continues down to the line of old Military road, reached at a gate. A path ahead continues down to the busy main road ahead, but this can be avoided by instead turning left along the line of the old Military Road, now a faint path follow a line of old fenceposts. This climbs slightly and rejoins the outward route at the fork above the transmitter mast. Continue ahead to return to the start.",

    "description": "A long history of access issues and problems - both in and out of the stag stalking season - have given these Munros the reputation of being one of the least friendly in Scotland for hillwalkers. The car park in Invervar is now closed, and the clearway order means that the nearest parking is just over 1km west of the village at a layby on the south side of the road, just beyond the clearway signs. Begin by heading along the road back to Invervar, then turning through through a gate in the village signed for the Lint Mill and to the Hill. Follow the marker posts to pass to the right of the circular mill building, soon joining a track. Turn left along the track through the woods. This soon leads through a gate and continues through a felled area.\n\nAt the top of the felled area pass through another gate to reach a large new hydro track. Do not follow this, instead turning left to follow the old track to the right of the deer fence. Further on this leads back onto a hydro track and crosses a bridge. Keep along the track until you see a rickety metal bridge over the burn down to the left - don't head for the gate, instead rounding the end of the fence and then crossing the bridge. Continue on the path up the far side of the burn around the edge of the forestry.\n\nThe path now swings left to begin the ascent proper, passing a small shieling and keeping to the right of the edge of the forest at first and then heading up the long but easy flank of Càrn Gorm, with good views back down Glen Lyon. The route steepens before reaching a small cairn on Creag Ghlas; from here the gradient relents before the final pull up towards the summit. There are two cairns - the first has a stunning view up Glen Lyon flanked by all its ranges, whilst the second - the true summit - has a broken trig point and a view over Loch Rannoch.\n\nDescend northwards, eventually curving ENE to reach a bealach at 851m at the foot of An Sgorr - a peak which looks rocky and impressive from down the Invervar glen. As it lacks Munro status most walkers bypass this peak by a path on its NW flank to reach a lower bealach beyond.\n\nContinue northeast up the open slope towards Meall Garbh; part way up a line of fenceposts coming up from the NW are joined. There are superb views in that direction, looking across Rannoch Moor and the upper part of Loch Rannoch to the Glen Coe and Ben Nevis ranges.\n\nThe fence posts which lead in a ENE direction to reach the summit of Meall Garbh. The summit is marked by a cairn 'decorated' with many fence posts. Schiehallion looks impressive, towering to the northeast. Continue east following a fainter line of fence posts (this cuts of the corner which is made if you follow the more distinct line of fence posts which is useful to do in very poor weather conditions when the path and other features cannot be made out) to a wide col; beyond this follow the fence posts to the flat and extensive summit of Meal a' Bharr (1004m).\n\nThe route continues east across almost flat ground; the rocky flank of Càrn Mairg can be seen on the right. Continue east, now ascending, until the ridge narrows, becoming rockier as it leads southeast to reach the summit of Càrn Mairg - the highest of the range at 1041m. It is worth exploring the small tor beyond which has good views down Glen Lyon and across to the Ben Lawers range. When leaving the summit care is needed to avoid the crags and steep section by heading east at first until gentler terrain is reached.\n\nFollow a faint path southeast and then south down to the next bealach. From here the path cllimbs steadily south to the summit ridge of Meall na Aighean (also often known as Creag Mhor). The actual summit is a small tor about 0.5 km east along the summit plateau. The summit cairn offers contrasting views, with the great arc of mountains round the north, west and southern horizons relenting to more rolling countryside to the east.\n\nOn leaving the summit retrace your steps briefly; you can either head over the west top or bypass it on the north side to begin the descent down the long ridge on the south side of the Allt Coire a'Chearcaill. There is a clear path down this ridge which has great views of Glen Lyon ahead, and it is not so steep that your feet are battered all the way down, making for a fine descent. Just before the ground steepens, cross a stalkers' path and continue straight ahead down the crest of the ridge. Eventually this path leads down to the hydro track almost opposite the gate used on the ascent. Go through this gate and retrace your steps back to the start.",

Begin by continuing on foot along the tarmac for a short distance to a junction beside the forest plantation. Turn right here through the gate.\n\nHead along the track, climbing gradually, for around 2km, until a grassy track forks off left. Take this, passing through a gate in a deer fence by a wooden shooting hut. When the grassy track curves left towards a gate in another deer fence, take the path off right towards the great dome of Càrn Liath which looms impressively ahead. There are pitched stones to help the path cross a boggy area, before the climb begins in earnest. This had become a very wide erosion scar visible from the A9 but has been repaired and is now an excellent pitched path.\n\nAfter the initial section past the remains of grouse butts on the wall the path steepens considerably up the heathery slopes. The directness does at least ensure the first Munro of the day is reached fairly quickly; there's a large first cairn before the slope eases. The actual summit cairn is just beyond the trig point at 975m. There are excellent views all around, and the best part of the days walk now stretches ahead.\n\nThe path follows a delightful ridge, curving left at first, then right and then left again, bypassing the crest of the final stretch of ridge on the left side before reaching the bealach. A path descends SE from here, making possible a much shorter walk if only the one summit is required. To continue the main route, a steeper climb begins from the bealach up towards the second Munro.\n\nThe gradient eases somewhat as the ascent continues round the edge of a scooped corrie to reach the summit cairn of Braigh Coire Chruinn-bhalgain, the central of Beinn a'Ghlò's three peaks. Finding the route to the next bealach requires care in poor visibility; you can either head over the minor summit E of point 1016m, then continue along the plateau edge until a safe descent, or you can follow a path from point 1016m that bypasses the ridge on the left side before petering out for the steeper descent of the eastern slope, joining a clearer path lower down.\n\nThe path heads down to the Bealach an Fhiodha, losing another 150m. Across the other side the path keeps left at first and later joins another path (coming in from the right) before making a rising traverse up onto the ridge of Càrn nan Gabhar - probably a tiring ascent by this point in the day. Once on the ridge the ascent is gentle but the ground becomes very stony. Bypass a prominent first cairn, and then the trig point, before finally reaching the well-built cairn on the true summit beyond.\n\nCàrn nan Gabhar is the highest summit of Beinn a'Ghlò at 1129 metres, with fine views into the wilds around the head of Glen Tilt. The return route to Loch Moraig is long and tiring. Retrace your steps initially; you can then head over Airgiod Bheinn for the return though the far side is very steep and stony. Our route instead retraces steps back to the Bealach an Fhiodha and then heads down the east side of the burn leading south. Further down the path becomes increasingly boggy, and it is best to cross to a clearer path on the opposite side of the burn.\n\nThe path crosses the burn twice more before crossing the Allt na Beinn Bige and then picking up the start of a well-constructed path which contours round the base of Beinn Bheag. Going underfoot is excellent now. Ignore a path off right, continuing until a track is reached. Turn right along this, eventually passing through a gate. Ultimately the track rejoins the outward route near the hut below Carn Liath. Retrace your steps to return to the start.",

Fork left off the track onto the excellent footpath and then ignore two other paths leading off to the left. The footpath crosses a track before reaching the whitewashed former farm which is now part of the National Nature Reserve, run by NatureScot; there are sheltered picnic tables here and a toilet. Continue on the path which soon becomes pitched as it climbs through the fine regenerating birchwoods. At a clear junction, ignore the red pine marten signpost and take the right hand branch which climbs gently.\n\nAfter around 1.5km from the car park, a stone-pitched path heads off amongst the birch trees on the right. This well constructed path climbs up through the woods. Continue up the rough hillside to just west of Na Cnapanan, with great views back over Loch Laggan.\n\nFrom here continue northwest - a branch path leads off, making for a long grind up the broad hillside, which becomes stonier near the summit. There are excellent views across to the great crags of Creag Meagaidh behind Coire Àrdair, relieving the monotony of the slope. The angle eases eventually onto a broad ridge, and the summit of Càrn Liath is marked by a large cairn. This is the first Munro of the day at a height of 1006 metres. Head west down the open slopes and over the insignificant swelling of Meall an t-Snaim.\n\nFrom here the slopes begin to narrow to form a ridge, and old iron rusty fence posts point the way towards the peculiar trench-like bealach of Uinneas Min Choire. There is a short, steep little ascent from here to reach Sròn Coire a'Chriochairein. From here the ridge becomes much better defined, with steep drops to the left and stunning views.\n\nCurve round the edge of the corrie and then continue west along the flat summit ridge to reach the summit cairn of Stob Poite a'Choire Àrdair beyond. This is the second Munro at 1053 metres. Descend south southwest to reach 'The Window', the bealach between the ridge just traversed and Creag Meagaidh itself. 'The Window' is set well back from Coire Àrdair and there is no view down to the lochan. Follow the path which climbs up the far side. If joining the route at this point following an ascent from the lochan, be sure to head to the west end of the Window, as a faint path heading up Creag Meagaidh from the east end is uncomfortably steep.\n\nThe slope soon eases into the vast plateau of Creag Meagaidh. Cross this to a giant, very old looking cairn on the northern fringe of the tablelands beyond - Mad Meg's cairn. This isn't the summit of the mountain though; for this, continue westwards where the plateau soon narrows to form a ridge. A short ascent along this ridge brings the cairn of Creag Meagaidh into view. This is the highest mountain in the area at 1130 metres, and the views are very extensive on a clear day. From here, return across the plateau and back down to 'The Window'.\n\nDescend the steep slopes leading east from the Window; the path is steep, stony and eroded and keeps to the left on the way down at first, before switching to the right on the second steep section. Further down it becomes grassier.\n\nThe scenery becomes ever more impressive as height is lost until Lochan Coire Àrdair is reached. This tiny sheet of water is utterly overpowered by the great bulk of Creag Meagaidh's cliffs high above. This is regarded as one of the best ice-climbing arenas in Scotland. From the lochan there is a clear path down the north bank of the Allt Coire Àrdair. The path is a little boggy at first but improves further down where it keeps further from the river. The lower part of the glen is clothed with a wonderful remnant of the ancient forest, and further still are the regenerating areas helped by the National Nature Reserve.

There are two cairns - the first has a stunning view up Glen Lyon flanked by all its ranges, whilst the second - the true summit - has a broken trig point and a view over Loch Rannoch.\n\nDescend northwards, eventually curving ENE to reach a bealach at 851m at the foot of An Sgorr - a peak which looks rocky and impressive from down the Invervar glen. As it lacks Munro status most walkers bypass this peak by a path on its NW flank to reach a lower bealach beyond.\n\nContinue northeast up the open slope towards Meall Garbh; part way up a line of fenceposts coming up from the NW are joined. There are superb views in that direction, looking across Rannoch Moor and the upper part of Loch Rannoch to the Glen Coe and Ben Nevis ranges.\n\nThe fence posts which lead in a ENE direction to reach the summit of Meall Garbh. The summit is marked by a cairn 'decorated' with many fence posts. Schiehallion looks impressive, towering to the northeast. Continue east following a fainter line of fence posts (this cuts of the corner which is made if you follow the more distinct line of fence posts which is useful to do in very poor weather conditions when the path and other features cannot be made out) to a wide col; beyond this follow the fence posts to the flat and extensive summit of Meal a' Bharr (1004m).\n\nThe route continues east across almost flat ground; the rocky flank of Càrn Mairg can be seen on the right. Continue east, now ascending, until the ridge narrows, becoming rockier as it leads southeast to reach the summit of Càrn Mairg - the highest of the range at 1041m. It is worth exploring the small tor beyond which has good views down Glen Lyon and across to the Ben Lawers range. When leaving the summit care is needed to avoid the crags and steep section by heading east at first until gentler terrain is reached.\n\nFollow a faint path southeast and then south down to the next bealach. From here the path cllimbs steadily south to the summit ridge of Meall na Aighean (also often known as Creag Mhor). The actual summit is a small tor about 0.5 km east along the summit plateau. The summit cairn offers contrasting views, with the great arc of mountains round the north, west and southern horizons relenting to more rolling countryside to the east.\n\nOn leaving the summit retrace your steps briefly; you can either head over the west top or bypass it on the north side to begin the descent down the long ridge on the south side of the Allt Coire a'Chearcaill. There is a clear path down this ridge which has great views of Glen Lyon ahead, and it is not so steep that your feet are battered all the way down, making for a fine descent. Just before the ground steepens, cross a stalkers' path and continue straight ahead down the crest of the ridge. Eventually this path leads down to the hydro track almost opposite the gate used on the ascent. Go through this gate and retrace your steps back to the start.",

    "description": "Park at the North Face car park (charge), reached along a track from Torlundy. Begin by heading along the track, over a bridge and past a vehicle barrier. When the track bends left, turn right on a path (signed North Face Trail). Go straight ahead uphill across the Puggy Trail, then keep right to stay on the main path at a fork. The path now takes a winding course uphill. Continue ahead when a smaller path joins from the left. Soon a bench is passed and there are great views over the head of Loch Linnhe and along Loch Eil. At another path junction bear right, signed ('North Face and CIC hut'). Pass a picnic table with another superb view. A track is reached at a bend, with a bridge on the right - go straight ahead up the track. At a track junction, turn right, now with stunning views of Ben Nevis ahead.\n\nAt the top of the track cross the stile and follow the excellent path as it continues up to the left of the Allt a'Mhuilin, with the north face of the Ben Nevis drawing ever closer. Eventually a boggy path forks off to the left; turn up this, which begins the long ascent to Càrn Mòr Dearg. Pretty wet lower down, the path improves as height is gained, giving stunning views back over Caol, Corpach and Lochs Linnhe and Eil.\n\nHigher up the path cuts across the southern slope of Càrn Beag Dearg, giving absolutely stunning views of the cliffs, buttresses and gullies of Ben Nevis before eventually climbing up to the ridge at Càrn Dearg Meadhonach. From here Càrn Mòr Dearg looks an elegant pointed peak which would attract admiring attention if it were not overshadowed by the awesome bulk of the Ben opposite. Continue along the ridge to the summit of Càrn Mòr Dearg.\n\nEyes will be drawn to the spectacular arête that leads around to the Ben in a graceful curve. This is the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête; there is an initial loose descent before the walk begins along the crest of this amazing ridge. There is a bypass path to the left, but keeping to the crest involves only minor scrambling over bouldery blocks - in an amazing situation.\n\nThe traverse is utterly involving and the situation beneath the great cliffs of the Ben is fantastic - there are few better ridge-walks than this. Eventually a minor peak is reached and the arête changes direction, curving to the right.\n\nIt descends to a low point before beginning to climb once more, with one particularly narrow section. The arête then climbs up to a flat shoulder - with a well-built cairn - beneath the bulk of the Ben itself. From here the route to the summit plateau is a steep climb up boulders with some sections of winding scree path.\n\nThe summit plateau is reached suddenly; as this is the highest peak in the UK, on a good day there will inevitably be lots of tourists who have come up the 'Mountain Track' - the crowds can come as a shock! There are several memorials, a trig point, and many cairns. There are also the remains of the (meteorological) observatory which operated here at the turn of the 19th century. The return is initially made by the 'Mountain Track', the main tourist route. In misty conditions and with snow covering the path, very careful navigation can be required to steer a course between Gardyloo Gully and Five Finger Gully. Follow a bearing of 231 degrees for 150 metres, and then a bearing of 281 degrees, to pass the most dangerous section.\n\nIn good weather with no snow there is a well worn path which zig-zags down towards Lochan Meall an t'Suidhe. This side of the mountain is owned by the John Muir Trust, a charity that protects wild places and maintains the path. You can find out more and support their work by joining at http://www.johnmuirtrust.org/. The path eventually crosses the Red Burn before reaching a path junction. Continue ahead here (the main tourist path down to Glen Nevis turns to the left), and keep left at a second fork to follow a constructed path to the loch outflow. From here make a rough, pathless descent NNE to reach the Allt a'Mhuillin - which can become impossible to cross if in spate (in which case continue downstream, go through the deer fence at a stile and continue on a rough path to the bridge and track to cross - don't cross at the water intake). Otherwise ford the burn and pick up the outward path on the far side, then retrace your steps back to the start.",

Cross the road (very carefully!) and head a short way along the verge to the north before going through a gate onto a vehicle track, passing under the pylons. and over the construction tracks for the new Beauly-Denny powerline. The hill track heads briefly north but soon bends to the right and begins to ascend the moor, with good views across the pass to A'Mharconaich and Geal Chàrn.\n\nContinue the easy ascent which keeps to the wide slope between two gullies. Nearing the plateau the track reaches an old quarry; the map is somewhat misleading in that this consists only of a shallow depression and a few blocks of quartz, and could be missed entirely when under snow. Continue on the track beyond the quarry, taking the left fork onto the broad ridge leading northeast. There is a line of fenceposts along here which may help navigation in mist. After a little under two kilometres the track is left as the ridge and fence bend to the right.\n\nA shallow depression is crossed before the final rise; this is very boggy underfoot unless it is frozen. Beyond, continue up the easy slope to the tiny cairn at the summit of Càrn na Caim. At 941 metres this is a Munro, and its position on the edge of the plateau makes it a good viewpoint. The dome of Meall Chuaich is in the foreground ahead, but the view extends across much of Badenoch to the Monadhliath, as well as across to the Cairngorms to the east and over range upon range to the west.\n\nReturn across the boggy bealach and back along the landrover track to where the plateau was initally reached, this time continuing south rather than returning to the 'quarry'. A track leads on at first, crossing a couple of dips in the plateau.\n\nBeyond the cairn on A'Buidheanach the plateau drops steeply, so it is better to bear left downhill a little before reaching this point to join a path skirting this lump. Another soggy bealach is crossed before a boggy path begins the ascent beyond, a little to the right of a small stream. The slope eases off as another plateau is reached, a short distance from the minor top of A'Buidheanach Mhor.\n\nHead southwest and then south for a short distance to reach the trig point of A'Buidheanach Bheag, the second Munro of the day at 936 metres. Truly dedicated baggers may notice on the map that there is a second summit at 936 about 500 metres to the west; it is impossible to say which is the true Munro summit but this second contender has no cairn and few visitors.\n\nOnce you are satisfied, return over all the bumps and dips back to the top of the landrover track near the 'quarry' for the easiest descent back to Drumochter.",

    "description": "Park in the car park (charge) near the end of the public road signed for Monzie; it is just before the cattle grid (near Loch Moraig, though this is out of sight). Begin by continuing on foot along the tarmac for a short distance to a junction beside the forest plantation. Turn right here through the gate.\n\nHead along the track, climbing gradually, for around 2km, until a grassy track forks off left. Take this, passing through a gate in a deer fence by a wooden shooting hut. When the grassy track curves left towards a gate in another deer fence, take the path off right towards the great dome of Càrn Liath which looms impressively ahead. There are pitched stones to help the path cross a boggy area, before the climb begins in earnest. This had become a very wide erosion scar visible from the A9 but has been repaired and is now an excellent pitched path.\n\nAfter the initial section past the remains of grouse butts on the wall the path steepens considerably up the heathery slopes. The directness does at least ensure the first Munro of the day is reached fairly quickly; there's a large first cairn before the slope eases. The actual summit cairn is just beyond the trig point at 975m. There are excellent views all around, and the best part of the days walk now stretches ahead.\n\nThe path follows a delightful ridge, curving left at first, then right and then left again, bypassing the crest of the final stretch of ridge on the left side before reaching the bealach. A path descends SE from here, making possible a much shorter walk if only the one summit is required. To continue the main route, a steeper climb begins from the bealach up towards the second Munro.\n\nThe gradient eases somewhat as the ascent continues round the edge of a scooped corrie to reach the summit cairn of Braigh Coire Chruinn-bhalgain, the central of Beinn a'Ghlò's three peaks. Finding the route to the next bealach requires care in poor visibility; you can either head over the minor summit E of point 1016m, then continue along the plateau edge until a safe descent, or you can follow a path from point 1016m that bypasses the ridge on the left side before petering out for the steeper descent of the eastern slope, joining a clearer path lower down.\n\nThe path heads down to the Bealach an Fhiodha, losing another 150m. Across the other side the path keeps left at first and later joins another path (coming in from the right) before making a rising traverse up onto the ridge of Càrn nan Gabhar - probably a tiring ascent by this point in the day. Once on the ridge the ascent is gentle but the ground becomes very stony. Bypass a prominent first cairn, and then the trig point, before finally reaching the well-built cairn on the true summit beyond.\n\nCàrn nan Gabhar is the highest summit of Beinn a'Ghlò at 1129 metres, with fine views into the wilds around the head of Glen Tilt. The return route to Loch Moraig is long and tiring. Retrace your steps initially; you can then head over Airgiod Bheinn for the return though the far side is very steep and stony. Our route instead retraces steps back to the Bealach an Fhiodha and then heads down the east side of the burn leading south. Further down the path becomes increasingly boggy, and it is best to cross to a clearer path on the opposite side of the burn.\n\nThe path crosses the burn twice more before crossing the Allt na Beinn Bige and then picking up the start of a well-constructed path which contours round the base of Beinn Bheag. Going underfoot is excellent now. Ignore a path off right, continuing until a track is reached. Turn right along this, eventually passing through a gate. Ultimately the track rejoins the outward route near the hut below Carn Liath. Retrace your steps to return to the start.",

    "description": "Take the minor road leading to the north end of the Loch Mullardoch dam. There is only very limited parking just beyond the dam; there is more space part way up the dam road on the right. Go through the gate at the end of the road and follow the track beyond, keeping above the ugly tide mark of the reservoir. The monument on the left commemorates the 'Chisholm stone' - the traditional gathering place of the glen - now submerged beneath the waters of the loch. The track has been improved for a hydro scheme - follow it on an undulating course to reach a hydro powerhouse and then cross the dilapidated bridge over the Allt Mullardoch beyond. On the far side leave the track to head directly northwest towards Mullach na Maoile.\n\nThe climb soon becomes steep up a slope of heather and bracken; the easiest line is between two tiny streambeds. From the flat top of the Mullach na Maoile, there is a slight dip before the final long stony rise to Càrn nan Gobhar, the first Munro of the day. There are two summits, the first with a very well-built cairn, whilst the second is the true summit, across a slight depression. The best views are to the west, looking across to the lochans, corries and ridges of Sgùrr na Lapaich.\n\nDescend the stone ridge to the Bealach na Cloiche Duibhe (Pass of the Black Rock). Sgùrr na Lapaich can look intimidating from here; the route of ascent is up the facing ridge, grassy lower down but rocky high up. Follow the narrow path up it; this keeps just to the left of the true ridge line, at one point following a strange lateral grassy ridge caused by a landslip; the ascent does cross a few short sections of boulders but avoids any scrambling. The ridge ends right by the summit, marked by a large wind-shelter cairn containing a trig point. The view is both extensive and dramatic, particularly back across the cliffs to Loch Tuill Bhearnach, whilst the next objective, the great ridged mountain of An Riabhachan, looks impressive to the west. Descend the fairly grassy ridge southwest to the Bealach Toll an Lochain.\n\nThe bealach is a low one at 820 metres so the re-ascent to An Riabhachan is considerable. A path leads up the first broad slope. This leads up to a fine, narrow grassy ridge that makes for a delightful ascent. The views back of the steep, broken slopes of Sgùrr na Lapaich towering over Loch Mòr are very impressive, whilst the ridge itself maintains interest in the route ahead. The climb ends when the ridge levels out at 1120 metres. It now widens but is grassy and the almost level walk along to the summit cairn of An Riabhachan is easy and enjoyable if the weather is good.\n\nThe well-built summit cairn has very steep slopes dropping down to the left and a glimpse of Loch Mullardoch, with the Càrn Eige range beyond it, but it is to the north that the view excels. Most of Loch Monar can be seen (rather spoiled by the water extraction tide-mark around it) whilst beyond and to the northwest rise a fantastic array of peaks stretching away into Torridon. Continue along the almost level ridge to the cairned summit at 1080 metres where the main ridge turns sharply left. Follow the path that continues west, soon descending very steeply to a lower section of ridge. The next section of this ridge is very narrow but easy enough; it then climbs slightly to a minor summit (which can be avoided on the left).\n\nThe ridge now descends southwest, the path on the crest avoiding the slabby blocks off to the right. There is then a second steep section of descent (easy scrambling) to reach the Bealach a'Bholla. An Socach looks impressive from here, the east top appearing as a steep pyramid crowning the ridge ahead (and giving the mountain its name). Follow the path directly up the ridge; there is one rocky step on the path but this can be easily avoided to the right. From the east top the ridge leads easily on to the main summit with a tumbledown windshelter cairn housing a trig point. An Socach is one of the remotest Munros in Scotland and its central position in the Northwest Highlands makes it a fabulous viewpoint. The coast and Skye look close in good visibility, whilst Torridon and the Monar peaks look fabulous. Nearer at hand there are good views across the dramatic eastern corrie towards Loch Mullardoch.\n\nFor the descent, follow the ridge along the edge of the corrie. After a couple of kilometres the descent steepens before reaching the start of the flat ridge stretching east to Meall Bac a' Chul-dhoire. This final section of ridge is riven by eroded peat hags and rather than continue across them at, it is probably best to bear left across the bogs to reach the nearby Allt Coire a' Mhaim. Cross this to pick up faint path down the far side. The path soon improves (though boggy in places) and leads down past several attractive waterfalls to approach close to the shores of Loch Mullardoch. Cross the Allt Socrach bridge on the left before following an initially faint path right almost to the tide-mark.\n\nYou are now faced with a very long and tiring walk back to the start. The path improves as it traverses across the very steep grassy slopes which plunge down to the loch. At several points care is needed as the drop onto the stony tide-mark is steep and the path is eroded in parts. After almost four kilometres of this undulating path the slope eases; the path now fades out. A kilometre further the foot of the Allt Taige is reached. There is no bridge over this stream and it could be a dangerous trap if the water is high (if in doubt, you should reverse the route so as to cross the Taige early in the day). The easiest place to cross is usually just above the outflow into the loch. On the far side, continue above the loch to reach a pinewood; pass just above this and continue traversing to reach the bridge over the Allt Mullardoch crossed earlier in the day. Now you simply have to follow the undulating, muddy track back to the start.",

In the winter access must be arranged in advance through Mountaineering Scotland. See their page on Strathfarrar access for further details. There are no access restrictions for walkers or cyclists and there is a car park near Milton Cottage. To start this walk, drive along the Glen until a flat grassy area between Loch Beannacharan and Loch a' Mhuillidh is reached. Here a track heads north and there is parking on the grass just off the track. Follow the track uphill.\n\nContinue on the track past the small dam on the stream and continue uphill. Where a small path branches off to the left, continue for a very short while on the faint track and follow a clearer path to the left - they both eventually join up as they follow the Allt Coire Mhuillidh upstream. At this point the second Munro of the day, Càrn nan Gobhar can be seen straight ahead, a rather insignificant looking grassy dome, and the first summit, Sgùrr na Ruaidhe, slightly to the right looks very easy, but much of the ascent cannot be seen from this angle. After crossing the first side stream, climb up the easy grassy slope in a north east direction - there is a faint path but at times this is indistinct and boggy.\n\nBefore you reach the top, a stone shelter is reached and then the summit cairn a little further on at 993m. The walk to the Bealach nam Botaichean in a north, west north direction is on lovely spongy moss and grass which is very easy going. There is a small steep section to the actual col and then a long and straightforward pull up first north north west and then as the steepness eases, westwards, to the summit of Càrn nan Gobhar. The last few metres are covered in boulders and there is a small cairn at the north edge at 992 metres where there is a good view of the route up Sgùrr a'Choire Ghlais.\n\nFrom the cairn, retrace your steps along the ridge south over the boulders a short way and then follow the pleasant grassy ridge southwards and then south west as it steepens to Bealach Sneachda at 865m. The steep pull up the other side is straightforward with a small path and a boulder section near the top. There is are two large cairns on the summit (1083m) and a trig point in between. There are good views north to Glen Orrin, Strathconon and to the Fannichs beyond. From the northern cairn, you can descend the rocky ridge or bypass the boulders by heading west from the trig point and then heading back north to the ridge to continue north west along the clear ridge.\n\nThe descent to Bealach Toll Sgaile is straightforward and as the ridge narrows and the views of Creag Ghorm a'Bhealaich improve makes an impressive section of the walk. On the ascent the summit of Creag Ghorm a'Bhealaich can be bypassed but the tiny detour to the top is worth it for the dramatic views down into the coire. From here there is only a small descent before the final pull to the summit of Sgùrr Fhuar-thuill at 1049m.\n\nFrom the summit continue west, just beyond the col at 987m a stalkers path leaves the ridge to the south west - a small cairn marks the spot. From here there are great views across to the slabby face of Sgùrr na Muice with Loch Toll a' Mhuic below. Follow the clear path as it descends steeply at first and then traverses below the ridge and descends to the eastern side of the Loch. Keep following the path until it crosses the stream and later becomes a track and follows the course of the Allt Toll a' Mhuic downhill with some impressive waterfalls and pleasant birchwoods.

    "description": "Park at the end of the minor road leading from Newtonmore into Glen Banchor. This is an attractive, surprisingly wild little glen given its position close to the town. Continue on foot along the track up the glen, almost immediately crossing the bridge over the Allt a Chaorainn. The track leads past a plantation and passes close to the site of a deserted township. Just before the house and bridge over the Allt Fionndrigh, take the track which bends off to the right. This leads up into Gleann Fiondrigh, which lacks the open aspect of Glen Banchor, being hemmed in by the foothills of the Monadhliath.\n\nContinue on the track up Gleann Fionndrigh until peters out into a boggy ATV track. Bear left from here to head down to a footbridge over the Allt Fhionndrigh. Follow the ATV track as it now heads southwest up towards a featureless bealach above the west side of the glen, becoming very boggy underfoot. On the wide bealach the route forks - ATV tracks swing both left and uphill to the right. Take the latter, then fork left part way up the slope.\n\nThe very boggy ATV tracks (which may not always be distinct) come closer to the Allt Ballach in upper Gleann Ballach, before rising gently up the eastern side of the glen. The summit of Càrn Dearg rises impressively atop a crag on the opposite side of the glen. As the head of Gleann Ballach is reached the route peters out towards the boggy bowl at the head of the glen.\n\nHere a wide grassy ramp enables an easier climb to the southwest, avoiding coming close to any crags. As height is gained the going becomes dry at last, and an improving path heads up onto the ridge a short distance north of the summit of Càrn Dearg. Continue along the edge to reach the summit cairn, which at 945 metres is the highest of the Monadhliath; the position of the cairn on the edge of the steep drop to Gleann Ballach ensures it is also the finest peak of the range.\n\nRetrace your steps briefly but then continue northwards onto the stony ground around the summit of Càrn Ban. North and west from here stretches the vast, empty and almost featureless plateau of the Monadhliath, as little visited as any ground in Britain. Our onward route is generally northeast, passing over the top of Càrn Ballach and then reaching Meall na Creughaich; all the time the ground underfoot becomes less stony and boggier. Another three kilometres from here, now heading eastwards, is Càrn Sgulain, the second of the day's Munros, and one of the most featureless on Sir Hugh's list.\n\nFinding the route all across the plateau from Càrn Ban to this Munro would be difficult indeed in bad visibility but a line of old metal fenceposts offers guidance. There is little to detain you on Càrn Sgulain's summit, which could be either a small cairn or a larger one slightly further on, so return a short distance southwest to the last bealach, then bearing south-southwest to cross the Allt Cuil na Caillich.\n\nThis stream has cut a steep little 'v'-shaped valley into the plateau, so heading this way is necessary to avoid the steepest drop down to it. Once across the stream and above the steep bank beyond, continue easily southeast to the third Munro, A'Chailleach.\n\nThis is a popular destination in its own right for walkers staying at Newtonmore, and the summit is marked by a huge cairn (visible for miles around across Badenoch), with a windshelter set into one side. The descent route has the benefit of a rough path for much of the way. Begin by heading south; the ascent eventually becomes more gradually and crosses a boggy area. Eventually it descends southeast near a burn into the glen, with great views down towards Newtonmore.\n\nThree-quarters of the way down you'll pass a little corrugated iron hut which offers very rough shelter on a wild day. Further down it is necessary to cross the Allt a'Chaorainn to reach a better path on the far side; this is usually possible using stones and boulders unless in spate (there's a footbridge a short distance downstream). Follow the path down the far side, which almost immediately becomes a track. This leads directly down the glen, passing the forestry plantations at its foot to return directly to the start.",

    "description": "Park at the end of the public road which leads to Fersit, where there is a very large turning area; park carefully to avoid obstructing any turning vehicles. Take the track which continues towards Fersit - signed as a right of way to Corrour Station. The track passes houses and crosses a bridge over the river and then railway. Keep right at a fork to pass between the houses of Fersit. At another fork go right, following the track that climbs up and passes to the right of a large metal barn. Pass through a gate onto the open moorland ground, and continue along the track until a branch on the right heads for a hut and pens.\n\nFrom here strike off southwards towards Stob Coire Sgriodain; there are various bits of path but generally the going is rough and very boggy.\n\nAim directly towards the steep nose of Sròn na Garbh-bheinne across the moor. As the ascent gets steeper several gullys cut across the slope from left heading up to the right; you can use these to aid progress at times, but generally just keep heading up until the rocky nose is gained. There are stunning views across to the Easains.\n\nContinue along a ridge section SSW before turning to make the final ascent up rocky slopes towards Stob Coire Sgriodain itself. The summit is a magnificent viewpoint, with Coire Sgriodain dropping very steeply away to the west giving tremendous depth to the views of Loch Treig, and beyond to the Mamores and the peaks of Glencoe.\n\nFollow a path down into the cleft of Glac Bhan, and continue the traverse over rocky ground covering point 958m. Eventually the stones relent and the route continues over smooth mossy slopes onto Chno Dearg. There are views to the lochan down in the coire to the left.\n\nIgnore traces of a grassy ATV route cutting across the west slopes of Chno Dearg, instead aiming up the smooth slopes towards the summit. Looking back, the outlying top of Meall Garbh reveals the hidden cliffs of Creagan Coire nan Cnamh.\n\nThe summit of Chno Dearg is marked by a huge cairn, and good views particularly over Loch Laggan, though they lack the drama of the view from Stob Coire Sgriodain.\n\nThe descent is down stony ground at first, but the going soon becomes boggy once more, down wet and featureless slopes. Aim to the right of Fersit, eventually picking up the right of way from Corrour. Head left along this to soon reach the track, and continue back through Fersit to return to the start.",

    "description": "Start from the layby on the north side of the A87 just over a kilometre east of the Cluanie Inn. Begin by walking east along the road to the remains of an old metal gate. Go through this to follow a path leading directly up the grassy ridge keeping the old forestry fence on your left. As height is gained, the fence is left below and good views open up of Loch Cluanie behind you.\n\nThe ascent continues at a similar gradient for almost two kilometres, where it begins to flatten out before reaching a minor cairned summit at 734 metres.\n\nContinue along the pleasant grass ridge, with steep slopes sweeping down to the empty glens on either side.\n\nThere is a slight descent before the ridge rises once more to reach the summit of Am Bathach, which, at 798m, is a Corbett. Continue northwest along the ridge from the summit; soon the way becomes ill-defined - head straight down the steep grass slope the the wide boggy saddle of Bealach Chòinnich.\n\nCross the bealach and begin the ascent of Ciste Dhubh. This has a very wide, steep grassy slope at this point; the initially soggy path heads up just to the right of the craggy area. Once above the steep section, the climb becomes much more pleasant and the ridge begins to narrow.\n\nThere is a prominent peak on the ridge known as An Cnapach, bordered by very steep slopes. The main path bypasses this peak on the west side, but purists will prefer to follow a faint path which heads directly to the top of the peak before descending the rocky slope on the other side, which the main path rejoins the ridge. Continue along the ridge, with An Cnapach looking really impressive behind.\n\nThe ridge climbs a little more before levelling off, with a great view of the dome summit of Ciste Dhubh ahead. The final climb to the summit is rocky but there are no real obstacles.\n\nCiste Dhubh means 'Black Chest' and at 979m it is a Munro - one of the most distinctive in the area. It may be lower than the surrounding peaks, but it is a fine summit with good views. Return back down the ridge to the Bealach Chòinich.\n\nThe walk can be extended from here by heading up the steep grassy slopes opposite to Sgùrr an Fhuarail and the Brothers Ridge. Otherwise head back down to the Bealach Chòinnich and continue ahead on the faint path which keeps to the west of the small lochans on the bealach. This starts to head downhill aiming south for a short distance before bearing southeast on the soggy path back down the east side of the An Caorainn Beag. It returns to the A87 just west of the layby where the walk began.",

    "description": "There is a car park just north of the house on the east side of the A835 just south of Inverlael Bridge. Start by going back out the car park entrance and then turning sharp right onto a track. Continue along the track towards the hills, with distant views towards Loch Broom to your left. Soon the track leads through a gate and into the Inverlael plantation. Ignore a track that heads off down the left and then one off up to the right. After 2km the track dips to cross a bridge over the river. Further on a track forks off left for Seana Bhràigh, one of the remotest Munros; our route continues up the main track through the forestry.\n\nAfter another kilometre a large turning area is reached, and the route continues on a path. This almost immediately exits the forestry at a gate and the walk now improves greatly as the route follows an old stalkers path up Gleann na Sguaib. Height is gained gradually on the excellent path which keeps well to the left above the burn, with grand views to Beinn Dearg ahead. After another couple of kilometres the path forks; the left path heads up towards Eididh nan Clach Geala and is used on the return, but our route keeps to the main glen path ahead.\n\nThere are impressive cliffs across the glen as Coire Mathair Lathail is reached and a burn is crossed at a confluence. The path now ascends between the two burns to eventually ascend up to Lochan Lathail, a truly beautiful spot. Beyond the lochan the path - which extends far beyond what is shown on some OS maps, despite a couple of indistinct stretches - climbs once more in a series of zig-zags to reach the barren, stony Bealach an Lochain Uaine. There is another series of small lochans here, and the bealach is the junction of several routes.\n\nOur route ascends Beinn Dearg first. To do so, head southeast across the wide bealach to meet a massive stone wall. Turn right alongside this, soon climbing steeply beside the wall and up over some bouldery ground. There are great views back over the bealach. The ascent is strenuous but the slope eventually eases; when you reach a corner where the wall turns right pass through a gap and aim slightly west of south to reach the huge summit cairn.\n\nAt 1084 metres this is the highest Munro north of the A835. The views are superb and very extensive with countless mountains in view; An Teallach is well seen to the northwest, whilst Loch Broom stretches away towards Assynt and Coigach. The photo shows the distant Torridon peaks seen over Loch a' Bhroain. Return to the wall and retrace your steps back down the steep slopes.\n\nThe second Munro to climb is Cona' Mheall. At the end of the wall, pass to the right of a small lochan and then follow a rough path that traverses the southern slopes of a hillock before descending to the east to reach a lower bealach. From here there are magnificent views south into Coire Ghranda with its fine loch. Beyond this bealach the ascent of Cona Mheall is up a wide open slope of grass and scree, with a final boulderfield before the summit, though a faint path helps avoid the worst of the boulders. For many years this was said to have been one of the only Munros with no summit cairn, but there is a small cairn at the 980 metre top today; but no man-made constructions can detract from the wild views across the Coire to the cliffs of Beinn Dearg. Retrace your steps back down to the first bealach and then back to Lochan Uaine.\n\nThis time, ascend the ridge which heads northwest from Lochan Uaine itself, ignoring a stalkers path that heads north. Keep the steep drop on your left and continue up the slope that leads easily to the third Munro of the day, Meall nan Ceapraichean. Continue over the minor bump of Ceann Garbh. The descent from here can be tricky if the best route isn't taken - head east towards a dip before cutting down. There is stony ground and boulders, and several bands of crags; eventually a path can be picked up that descends along the top of one of these lines of crags that slopes down to the next bealach.\n\nThe climb up to Eididh nan Clach Geala is on easier on mostly grassy slopes. There are two cairns - the first is the highest, but the second cairn a short distance beyond is the finest viewpoint. If you are lucky with the weather and light conditions, this fourth and lowest Munro at 928 metres is a great place to enjoy the spectacular view northwest to the mountains of Coigach and Assynt, with Stac Pollaidh prominent.\n\nContinue the walk by descending the west ridge for almost a kilometre before dropping steeply southwards to join up with a stalkers path coming down from Loch a Chnapaich, with great views back to Beinn Dearg and Meall nan Ceapraichean. Follow this stalkers path downhill until it rejoins the outward route in Gleann na Sguaib, then turn right to return to the start by the route of ascent.",

    "description": "Park at the public car park in front of the Inchnadamph Hotel. The walk begins a short distance further north along the road; follow the A837 over its bridge over the River Trallgill and then turn right onto the private road to Inchnadamph Lodge. This leads past the independent hostel and field centre and heads through a gate. Ignore a track off left, instead continuing until the glen track crosses the Allt Poll an Droighinn on a concrete bridge. On the far side you can shortcut a zig-zag by heading straight ahead and rejoining the main track.\n\nFurther on is the isolated white-washed holiday cottage of Glenbain. Continue past Glenbain up the glen, now on a good path, passing to the right of a plantation after about another kilometre. Shortly after this the path forks; the signed right branch heads for the Traligill caves, popular with pot-holers, but to continue our route towards the mountains keep left. Keep on the north side of Gleann Dubh, which becomes narrower and steep sided.\n\nAfter 4.5km or so from the start the climb begins in earnest. A boggy section is followed by a badly eroded path climbing up the north side of the Allt a' Choinne Mhill. Much higher up the gradient relents into a shallow grassy corrie. The path soon crosses the burn and then climbs up towards the base of a band of quartzite crags. These are most easily ascended as a rocky staircase not far to the right of the burn. There are a few cairns that may help mark the route.\n\nAbove the line of crags an upper corrie is reached, with the bealach between Conival and Beinn an Fhurain beyond. Now the route begins to head up the north ridge of Conival on a stony path; there are a fine views looking over into Coire a'Mhadaidh, its lochan overshadowed by the impressive quartzite buttresses of Na Tuadhan.\n\nHigher up is a better defined section of ridge, grassy going giving relief from the stones for a while. Beyond this the ridge climbs again, with some fine crags on the SW side, eventually reaching the summit cairn of Conival at a junction of three ridges. The cairn takes the form of a wind-shelter and has grand views looking back along Loch Assynt.\n\nThe east ridge leads the eye across masses of scree slopes to Ben More Assynt; traversing the ridge is very rough going and more time consuming than you might expect. Head east and then descend traces of a path down an initial slope of crags and boulders. There is then a stony arête before another descent down to the bealach. Beyond this the ridge climbs again with more stones and scree, climbing up to point 974 before descending steeply.\n\nClimb more stones for the final ascent to the summit of Ben More Assynt. At 998m this is the highest mountain over a vast area of Northern Scotland as well as being the second Munro of the day; the view is of a majestic, desolate, sweeping bare wilderness in all directions.\n\nThe ridge leading south from Ben More Assynt is said to be a challenging scramble, but would lead many miles from the nearest road. Instead, retrace your outward route back along the rocky ridge to Conival.\n\nFrom the summit of Conival, turn north to continue retracing your steps the way you came, enjoying the superb views over Loch Assynt. Keep heading back all the way to the bealach and down the glen to return to Inchnadamph.",

    "summary": "This marvellous but long and arduous ridge walk is a Munro-baggers delight. Nowhere else in the Highlands can so many peaks be climbed in a day, with minimal descent between the summits, and the views are excellent all the way. However, this is a long day with steep ground on either side of the ridge - route finding skills and a fast pace are required. If in any doubt about fitness, the route can be split into two days by using the Druim na Coire nan Eirecheanach ridge to descend from the ridge at the end of the first day, and use the Druim Thollaidh ridge to regain the ridge to begin the second day.",
    "description": "The whole ridge on the south side of Glen Shiel is described as a single walk. Although a long day, this is the way most walkers tackle it. Note that this walk finishes around nine kilometres down the A87 from the start point, so you will probably want to arrange transport back up the glen, leave a bike, or try to time things for the bus service. Just east of the Cluanie Inn is the start of the old road from Cluanie to Tomdoun; it is possible to park fifty metres along this road. The walk begins by continuing along this private road soon crossing a bridge. At a fork keep right; the lower route goes to Cluanie Lodge. As the route climbs there are great views back over Loch Cluanie and the old road crosses a lovely stone bridge.\n\nContinue onwards all the way until a bealach.Even though it might feels wrong to lose height, this route is much easier going than crossing the rough pathless ground on the more direct line, so continue for another kilometre after the bealach. Just before another small bridge look out for a cairn on the right marking a stalkers path. The path climbs up zig-zags to the ridge, keep straight on where a smaller path, marked with a tiny cairn, forks left. There are great views back over Loch Loyne.\n\nThe summit of Creag a' Mhaim is the first Munro of the day at 947 metres. The most strenuous climb of the walk is now already behind, as the marvellous South Glen Shiel Ridge stretches ahead.\n\nThere is only a very short descent to the first col, after which the ridge begins to narrow on the gradual climb up to the second peak. The final section of ridge before the summit of Druim Shionnach is very narrow and rocky and can be avoided by using a bypass path just off to the left; you have now reached your second Munro at 987m.\n\nThe next peak is three kilometres further along the ridge, though the undulations are fairly gentle. There are great slabby crags sweeping down into the corries to the north, but the southern slopes are much gentler. The reward is your third Munro, Aonach air Chrith which at 1021m is the highest summit on the whole ridge. From here, most of the rest of the days ridge can be seen winding ahead. Shortly after the summit there is a narrow and rocky section of ridge (which can be bypassed) and soon a narrow grassy path enables a faster pace once more.\n\nThe ridge undulates over a couple of very minor summits before ascending to the fourth Munro, Maol Chinn-Dearg (981metres). From here the path along the ridge bypasses the top of the minor peak of Sgùrr Coire na Feinne before a long slow ascent to munro number five, Sgùrr an Doire Leathain (1010 metres).\n\nThe very summit of this mountain is a short distance along the northeast ridge and requires a slight detour NE. It has a fine view of the next peak, Sgùrr an Lochain which is the most distinctive on the whole ridge. Return to the main ridge, which now has good views down to the loch in Coire Lochain, and climbs easily up to Sgùrr an Lochain (1004 m).\n\nEnjoy the view from this sixth and finest Munro of the day before heading along the seemingly endless ridge once more. The next peak Sgùrr Beag is not a Munro and most walkers have worn a path which avoids its summit, passing to the south side, before the ridge drops to its lowest point at 729 metres with a little lochan. The climb up to the final Munro (Creag nan Dàmh) is likely to be a trial for worn-out limbs. Continue along the ridge and after a pronounced dip, take care on the short, straightforward, scramble up the far side.\n\nStay on the ridge for nearly 2km from the final peak, following the remains of a drystone dyke to the Bealach Duibh Leac where a small cairn marks where to turn north to start the steeper part of the descent. From here follow an old stalkers path, initially faint but marked by some small cairns at first, which winds down the northern slope and is boggy and rocky in places. Further down it becomes clearer and crosses, then leads down the west side of the Allt Coire Mhurlagain. Later on, keep the fence on your left and as the road in the bottom of the glen comes into view, the path forks. The main left branch leads to a ford over the burn, whilst the boggy right hand one veers away from the fence to reach an old footbridge at NG 970134. From here continue down through bracken, in the summer, to a gate leading to the A87. Now all you need to do is get back to your start point several km back up the busy road - there is a layby just to the right.",

    "description": "Park at the layby on the east side of the A93, about two kilometres north of the Glenshee Ski Centre. Do not head for the arched wooden bridge, instead following a rougher path down to the grass-covered old stone bridge which was once part of the military road from Perth to Braemar. Soon the route becomes simply a path, but the going also becomes a little drier underfoot. The path is hard to follow in parts, passing two sets of old shielings.\n\nAfter the second set of shielings the path reaches a tributary burn; head up beside this briefly before finding a good crossing place. A rough path now continues towards the stony dome of Càrn an Tuirc. The climb is initially through grass and heather, and then the path peters out in a boggy section. Higher up, it is possible to avoid most of the stones. There are great views back towards the Cairnwell Pass.\n\nThe summit cairn and adjacent small shelter cairn sit together on the flat plateau at 1019 metres; this first of the day's Munros has a great feeling of space though the plateau robs the panorama of much depth; the Cairngorms look fine across Deeside. Head east towards a subsidary cairn then ESE, descending gently to reach a grassy track.\n\nIf the weather is good, it is worth diverting to try to get a view down into Coire Loch Kander, a classic mountain corrie in total contrast to the plateau. Otherwise, to continue the walk, follow the grassy track SSE towards Cairn of Claise, initially across truly featureless grassy terrain. Eventually the track fades out near the end of a drystone wall on the right - follow the wall, which marks the old county boundary. The going now becomes stonier underfoot; the summit cairn at 1064m is just on the left side of the wall. Head southwest along the broad ridge, initially beside the stone wall.\n\nSoon it is possible to diverge from the wall to pick up a track just to the left of a tiny lochan. The track west, then southwest, then south, eventually cutting across the east side of Glas Maol. Leave it at a suitable point (there may be a tiny cairn) to ascend directly to reach the large cairn and triangulation pillar atop Glas Maol. At 1068 metres, this is the highest of the day's Munros; the plateau extends for miles to the east and north, eventually merging with Lochnagar.\n\nVery easy but featureless grassy terrain is crossed SW towards a prominent cairn at Bathach Beag. From here a wall is followed southwards along the now better defined ridge. At the bealach there is a tiny stone shelter on the east side of the wall - barely enough to accommodate a sheep! From here the walk acquires more character, and rockier slopes take over on the ascent to Cul Riabhach, and then ascends to the stony summit of Creag Leacach, the lowest but finest of the four Munros at 987 metres.\n\nFrom here there is a choice of routes. Under snow the route we describe crosses a very steep avalanche prone slope on a path which is likely to be banked out - at such times it is better to descend SW from Creag Leachach to the SW Top, then down to the bealach with Meall Gorm before heading NE down to the Allt Coire a' Bhathaich, returning to the start with a tiring road walk over the Cairnwell Pass. In summer though, the quickest and most pleasant option is probably to retrace your steps back to the cairn at Bathach Beag, and then follow an initially very faint, narrow path that contours the west side of Glas Maol - initially across grassy slopes but later across the steep slope.\n\nThis leads out onto the Meall Odhar ridge, where a zig-zag path coming down from the summit of Glas Maol is joined. Follow this to the left to reach the top of the ski tows. From here a track leads down through the upper part of the ski area, reaching a peat-hagged bealach where there are several buildings which are part of the ski centre. Continue on the track down to the top of the Cairnwell Pass. From here it's around 2.5km walk northwards downhill alongside the busy road to the return to the start.",

    "description": "There is a good-sized car park at Aberarder on the north side of the A86, opposite Loch Laggan. Fork left off the track onto the excellent footpath and then ignore two other paths leading off to the left. The footpath crosses a track before reaching the whitewashed former farm which is now part of the National Nature Reserve, run by NatureScot; there are sheltered picnic tables here and a toilet. Continue on the path which soon becomes pitched as it climbs through the fine regenerating birchwoods. At a clear junction, ignore the red pine marten signpost and take the right hand branch which climbs gently.\n\nAfter around 1.5km from the car park, a stone-pitched path heads off amongst the birch trees on the right. This well constructed path climbs up through the woods. Continue up the rough hillside to just west of Na Cnapanan, with great views back over Loch Laggan.\n\nFrom here continue northwest - a branch path leads off, making for a long grind up the broad hillside, which becomes stonier near the summit. There are excellent views across to the great crags of Creag Meagaidh behind Coire Àrdair, relieving the monotony of the slope. The angle eases eventually onto a broad ridge, and the summit of Càrn Liath is marked by a large cairn. This is the first Munro of the day at a height of 1006 metres. Head west down the open slopes and over the insignificant swelling of Meall an t-Snaim.\n\nFrom here the slopes begin to narrow to form a ridge, and old iron rusty fence posts point the way towards the peculiar trench-like bealach of Uinneas Min Choire. There is a short, steep little ascent from here to reach Sròn Coire a'Chriochairein. From here the ridge becomes much better defined, with steep drops to the left and stunning views.\n\nCurve round the edge of the corrie and then continue west along the flat summit ridge to reach the summit cairn of Stob Poite a'Choire Àrdair beyond. This is the second Munro at 1053 metres. Descend south southwest to reach 'The Window', the bealach between the ridge just traversed and Creag Meagaidh itself. 'The Window' is set well back from Coire Àrdair and there is no view down to the lochan. Follow the path which climbs up the far side. If joining the route at this point following an ascent from the lochan, be sure to head to the west end of the Window, as a faint path heading up Creag Meagaidh from the east end is uncomfortably steep.\n\nThe slope soon eases into the vast plateau of Creag Meagaidh. Cross this to a giant, very old looking cairn on the northern fringe of the tablelands beyond - Mad Meg's cairn. This isn't the summit of the mountain though; for this, continue westwards where the plateau soon narrows to form a ridge. A short ascent along this ridge brings the cairn of Creag Meagaidh into view. This is the highest mountain in the area at 1130 metres, and the views are very extensive on a clear day. From here, return across the plateau and back down to 'The Window'.\n\nDescend the steep slopes leading east from the Window; the path is steep, stony and eroded and keeps to the left on the way down at first, before switching to the right on the second steep section. Further down it becomes grassier.\n\nThe scenery becomes ever more impressive as height is lost until Lochan Coire Àrdair is reached. This tiny sheet of water is utterly overpowered by the great bulk of Creag Meagaidh's cliffs high above. This is regarded as one of the best ice-climbing arenas in Scotland. From the lochan there is a clear path down the north bank of the Allt Coire Àrdair. The path is a little boggy at first but improves further down where it keeps further from the river. The lower part of the glen is clothed with a wonderful remnant of the ancient forest, and further still are the regenerating areas helped by the National Nature Reserve.

Keep right here, continuing along the hydro track until it heads through a gate in a deer fence.\n\nOnce through the gate leave the track and turn right, following the fenceline uphill; continue by the fence when it turns right. Continue to reach a stile in the upper deer fence. Now on open ground, the craggy slopes of Sròn nan Eun rise above. Climb diagonally north to pass the first broken crags, then aim WNW up grassy slopes below the higher upper crags. Soon a wide grassy brake in the cliffs enables you to ascend steeply northwards until above the steep ground. Now continue up easier slopes - soon accompanied by a faint path - onto the ridge of Sròn nan Eun. Now the upper cone of Creag Mhòr comes into view at last, still some distance away.\n\nContinue along the ridge, crossing two small depressions. The path becomes better defined and the ground steeps on the final ascent of the rockier upper slopes. Eventually the large summit cairn is at 1048m is reached - a satisfying viewpoint with mountains in all directions.\n\nThere are impassable crags blocking the direct route to the bealach dividing Creag Mhòr from Beinn Heasgarnich, so instead it is necessary to descend the easier ground to the west and then northwest along the initial section of ridge leading towards Meall Tionaill before heading back ENE to the bealach once easier slopes are reached. Cross the peat bog here before beginning the ascent up the steep grassy slopes to Sròn Tairbh.\n\nContinue up along the ridge to the top of Stob an Fhir-Bhoga. From here a very broad grassy ridge leads across the wide ridge towards Beinn Heasgarnich itself. There are stunning views looking back to Creag Mhòr and Beinn Challum.\n\nEventually the cairn marking the summit of Beinn Heasgarnich is reached. This is superb viewpoint, but the bad news is that the descent is tricky and tedious, with broken crags and vast areas of peat bog to negotiate. Aim east down broken slopes, passing just north of a small lochan, heading down into Coire Ban Mòr .\n\nThere are many steep burns carving ravines down this slope, and its best to get to the south side of them. After the flatter middle ground there's a steeper descent again to gain the level of the Moine Achlarich - a massive peat bog. The north bank of the Allt Tarsuinn has the driest ground and can be followed - but if in spate, you need to make sure you get to the south side of both it and another adjacent burn before they become uncrossable.\n\nAim for the summit of the private Glen Lochay - Glen Lyon road - the solid tarmac will be reached with much relief! Turn right to follow the road which leads back down into Glen Lochay and to the start of the walk.",

    "description": "A long history of access issues and problems - both in and out of the stag stalking season - have given these Munros the reputation of being one of the least friendly in Scotland for hillwalkers. The car park in Invervar is now closed, and the clearway order means that the nearest parking is just over 1km west of the village at a layby on the south side of the road, just beyond the clearway signs. Begin by heading along the road back to Invervar, then turning through through a gate in the village signed for the Lint Mill and to the Hill. Follow the marker posts to pass to the right of the circular mill building, soon joining a track. Turn left along the track through the woods. This soon leads through a gate and continues through a felled area.\n\nAt the top of the felled area pass through another gate to reach a large new hydro track. Do not follow this, instead turning left to follow the old track to the right of the deer fence. Further on this leads back onto a hydro track and crosses a bridge. Keep along the track until you see a rickety metal bridge over the burn down to the left - don't head for the gate, instead rounding the end of the fence and then crossing the bridge. Continue on the path up the far side of the burn around the edge of the forestry.\n\nThe path now swings left to begin the ascent proper, passing a small shieling and keeping to the right of the edge of the forest at first and then heading up the long but easy flank of Càrn Gorm, with good views back down Glen Lyon. The route steepens before reaching a small cairn on Creag Ghlas; from here the gradient relents before the final pull up towards the summit. There are two cairns - the first has a stunning view up Glen Lyon flanked by all its ranges, whilst the second - the true summit - has a broken trig point and a view over Loch Rannoch.\n\nDescend northwards, eventually curving ENE to reach a bealach at 851m at the foot of An Sgorr - a peak which looks rocky and impressive from down the Invervar glen. As it lacks Munro status most walkers bypass this peak by a path on its NW flank to reach a lower bealach beyond.\n\nContinue northeast up the open slope towards Meall Garbh; part way up a line of fenceposts coming up from the NW are joined. There are superb views in that direction, looking across Rannoch Moor and the upper part of Loch Rannoch to the Glen Coe and Ben Nevis ranges.\n\nThe fence posts which lead in a ENE direction to reach the summit of Meall Garbh. The summit is marked by a cairn 'decorated' with many fence posts. Schiehallion looks impressive, towering to the northeast. Continue east following a fainter line of fence posts (this cuts of the corner which is made if you follow the more distinct line of fence posts which is useful to do in very poor weather conditions when the path and other features cannot be made out) to a wide col; beyond this follow the fence posts to the flat and extensive summit of Meal a' Bharr (1004m).\n\nThe route continues east across almost flat ground; the rocky flank of Càrn Mairg can be seen on the right. Continue east, now ascending, until the ridge narrows, becoming rockier as it leads southeast to reach the summit of Càrn Mairg - the highest of the range at 1041m. It is worth exploring the small tor beyond which has good views down Glen Lyon and across to the Ben Lawers range. When leaving the summit care is needed to avoid the crags and steep section by heading east at first until gentler terrain is reached.\n\nFollow a faint path southeast and then south down to the next bealach. From here the path cllimbs steadily south to the summit ridge of Meall na Aighean (also often known as Creag Mhor). The actual summit is a small tor about 0.5 km east along the summit plateau. The summit cairn offers contrasting views, with the great arc of mountains round the north, west and southern horizons relenting to more rolling countryside to the east.\n\nOn leaving the summit retrace your steps briefly; you can either head over the west top or bypass it on the north side to begin the descent down the long ridge on the south side of the Allt Coire a'Chearcaill. There is a clear path down this ridge which has great views of Glen Lyon ahead, and it is not so steep that your feet are battered all the way down, making for a fine descent. Just before the ground steepens, cross a stalkers' path and continue straight ahead down the crest of the ridge. Eventually this path leads down to the hydro track almost opposite the gate used on the ascent. Go through this gate and retrace your steps back to the start.",

    "summary": "This marvellous but long and arduous ridge walk is a Munro-baggers delight. Nowhere else in the Highlands can so many peaks be climbed in a day, with minimal descent between the summits, and the views are excellent all the way. However, this is a long day with steep ground on either side of the ridge - route finding skills and a fast pace are required. If in any doubt about fitness, the route can be split into two days by using the Druim na Coire nan Eirecheanach ridge to descend from the ridge at the end of the first day, and use the Druim Thollaidh ridge to regain the ridge to begin the second day.",
    "description": "The whole ridge on the south side of Glen Shiel is described as a single walk. Although a long day, this is the way most walkers tackle it. Note that this walk finishes around nine kilometres down the A87 from the start point, so you will probably want to arrange transport back up the glen, leave a bike, or try to time things for the bus service. Just east of the Cluanie Inn is the start of the old road from Cluanie to Tomdoun; it is possible to park fifty metres along this road. The walk begins by continuing along this private road soon crossing a bridge. At a fork keep right; the lower route goes to Cluanie Lodge. As the route climbs there are great views back over Loch Cluanie and the old road crosses a lovely stone bridge.\n\nContinue onwards all the way until a bealach.Even though it might feels wrong to lose height, this route is much easier going than crossing the rough pathless ground on the more direct line, so continue for another kilometre after the bealach. Just before another small bridge look out for a cairn on the right marking a stalkers path. The path climbs up zig-zags to the ridge, keep straight on where a smaller path, marked with a tiny cairn, forks left. There are great views back over Loch Loyne.\n\nThe summit of Creag a' Mhaim is the first Munro of the day at 947 metres. The most strenuous climb of the walk is now already behind, as the marvellous South Glen Shiel Ridge stretches ahead.\n\nThere is only a very short descent to the first col, after which the ridge begins to narrow on the gradual climb up to the second peak. The final section of ridge before the summit of Druim Shionnach is very narrow and rocky and can be avoided by using a bypass path just off to the left; you have now reached your second Munro at 987m.\n\nThe next peak is three kilometres further along the ridge, though the undulations are fairly gentle. There are great slabby crags sweeping down into the corries to the north, but the southern slopes are much gentler. The reward is your third Munro, Aonach air Chrith which at 1021m is the highest summit on the whole ridge. From here, most of the rest of the days ridge can be seen winding ahead. Shortly after the summit there is a narrow and rocky section of ridge (which can be bypassed) and soon a narrow grassy path enables a faster pace once more.\n\nThe ridge undulates over a couple of very minor summits before ascending to the fourth Munro, Maol Chinn-Dearg (981metres). From here the path along the ridge bypasses the top of the minor peak of Sgùrr Coire na Feinne before a long slow ascent to munro number five, Sgùrr an Doire Leathain (1010 metres).\n\nThe very summit of this mountain is a short distance along the northeast ridge and requires a slight detour NE. It has a fine view of the next peak, Sgùrr an Lochain which is the most distinctive on the whole ridge. Return to the main ridge, which now has good views down to the loch in Coire Lochain, and climbs easily up to Sgùrr an Lochain (1004 m).\n\nEnjoy the view from this sixth and finest Munro of the day before heading along the seemingly endless ridge once more. The next peak Sgùrr Beag is not a Munro and most walkers have worn a path which avoids its summit, passing to the south side, before the ridge drops to its lowest point at 729 metres with a little lochan. The climb up to the final Munro (Creag nan Dàmh) is likely to be a trial for worn-out limbs. Continue along the ridge and after a pronounced dip, take care on the short, straightforward, scramble up the far side.\n\nStay on the ridge for nearly 2km from the final peak, following the remains of a drystone dyke to the Bealach Duibh Leac where a small cairn marks where to turn north to start the steeper part of the descent. From here follow an old stalkers path, initially faint but marked by some small cairns at first, which winds down the northern slope and is boggy and rocky in places. Further down it becomes clearer and crosses, then leads down the west side of the Allt Coire Mhurlagain. Later on, keep the fence on your left and as the road in the bottom of the glen comes into view, the path forks. The main left branch leads to a ford over the burn, whilst the boggy right hand one veers away from the fence to reach an old footbridge at NG 970134. From here continue down through bracken, in the summer, to a gate leading to the A87. Now all you need to do is get back to your start point several km back up the busy road - there is a layby just to the right.",

    "description": "Park in a layby on the A86 just east of the track leading over the bridge over the River Laggan. Follow the track; there is a branch off to the left just before the main track heads through the trees to some houses - take this branch to continue across the moor. There are soon great views to the right over a wide meander in the Abhain Guilbinn to the distant Grey Corries. Continue on the track for around a kilometre to a junction near some pine trees; turn sharp right here. The track now leads into a wild area with Beinn a'Chlachair ahead on the left and the distant peaks of the Aonach Beag range to its right. When the track forks, keep left, passing to the left of a small reservoir. Follow the track to the southern end of Lochan na h-Earba, crossing the bridge over its feeder stream. There is a stunning sandy beach on the left just beyond looking up the deep trench-like glen holding the two lochs.\n\nThe main track now runs along the head of the loch before swinging to the right in a loop. Look out for a small cairn that indicates the start of a grassy path which is a short-cut to the main stalkers path you now need to follow. Join this and follow it uphill; it soon runs alongside the Allt Coire Pitridh. The surface has been improved in places and the path is almost as good as a track. Pass some ruined shielings and higher up cross a feeder stream coming down from the east. About half a kilometre further up, leave this excellent path and cross the Allt Coire Pitridh, heading up the steep grassy bank on the far side. The ground ahead is boggy in places; make a bee-line across it to the south. Beyond climb the initially very steep slopes ahead, bearing a little to the right to reach the eastern rim of Coire Mòr Chlachair higher up. The corrie is quite a dramatic scoop out of the mountain and the summit of Beinn a'Chlachair comes into view across it.\n\nContinue round the rim of the corrie, passing to the left (or over) a rocky wart prominent in some distant views. The ground is a mixture of loose stones and grassy patches and the slope becomes easier as it finally merges into the spacious plateau of Beinn a'Chlachair. The summit is at the far side of the corrie; there is briefly a path before the final stony slopes are reached leading to the large cairn with a windshelter on the northwest side. At 1087 metres this is the highest of the three Munros and the view is probably the most extensive. Chno Dearg is the nearest prominent peak to the west, backed by the impressive Easains and the Grey Corries. South is the very remote Aonach Beag range whilst to the east are the two peaks making up the rest of the days walk - Geal Chàrn looks (and is!) a long way from here. Head back down the stony slope and then continue across the plateau towards it - there is a path on the grassy sections though it is lost on the stones.\n\nThe plateau ends abruptly in cliffs above Loch a'Bhealaich Leamhain. The descent is to the north, either directly down the corner of the slopes towards the Bhealach Leamhain - which is very steep and rocky, requiring some scrambling and route finding, or a couple of hundred metres further west where the descent to the north is just as steep but grassier. If taking this latter option, once easier ground is reached you can traverse to the right to meet the stalkers path from the bealach rather than continuing directly down over the bogs. Follow the path to the left to reach the stalkers path junction of Coire Pitridh.\n\nHere turn right to trace the excellent path heading north over the col between Creag Pitridh and Geal Chàrn. Stay on this path for around half a kilometre until it begins to traverse the slopes and a convenient place is reached to leave it and head directly for Geal Chàrn. The slopes are easy at first with a few stony sections higher up. There are a couple of false summits - Geal Chàrn seems further than might be expected - but eventually the true summit comes into view ahead. This has its own name - Mullach Coire an Iubhair - and consists of a small stony cone topped with a very well-built cairn (and a trig point behind); a fine summit for such a sprawling mountain. The best parts of the view are back to Beinn a'Chlachair and the more distant view east towards the Cairngorms. Return back along the ridge before diverting to the right to reach the bealach below Creag Pitridh. This peak looks tiny compared to its mighty neighbours - a mere bump on the slopes of Geal Chàrn, but on closer acquaintance it begins to look very steep.\n\nAt the bealach the stalkers path is reached once more; cross over it. Luckily there is a path up Creag Pitridh, making the ascent much more straightforward; this aims straight for the top at first before dog-legging left and then finally to the right across quartzite rocks to the summit. Although only 924 metres it has perhaps the most beautiful view of the three Munros, with the two Lochan na h-Earba and Loch Laggan prominent. For the descent, follow a path at first to the west which leads down the steeper upper section. Once the flatter shoulder is reached bear left off the ridge to make a long descent of straightforward, mostly grassy slopes. Aim for the confluence where the stream from the bealach meets the Allt Coire Pitridh - this avoids boggy ground further east. At the confluence the stalkers path from the outward route is joined. Turn right along this and retrace your steps all the way back to the start.",

    "description": "These two hills look fine from the Kinghouse Hotel, where the northern end of the Creise ridge descends dramatically in the crags of Sròn na Creise. This offers a classic route of ascent but requires both a river crossing and a difficult, exposed scramble. The route described here is more straightforward. Turn south from the A82 as it crosses Rannoch Moor onto the minor road to the Glencoe Mountain Ski Centre and follow it to the ski car park at White Corries. Begin the walk by heading to the right of the main building and the foot of the chair lift, then aim between the two higher ski centre buildings before turning right onto a signed path beneath the chairlift.\n\nThe path climbs uphill, soon meeting a mountain bike track. Go straight across this, continuing uphill and becoming steep and very eroded, crossing a minor burn at one point. The route is under the shadow of the chairlift that climbs this same slope - and which may tempt the lazier walkers to use the uplift on this initial climb.\n\nWhen the slope finally eases take a signed path which passes well to the right of the upper chairlift station. This soon joins a wide path running from the chairlift (to your left) and the top of point 748m to your right - turn towards the latter. After crossing a metal bridge over a burn the easiest option is to turn left off the main path onto a narrow path with red marker posts (watch out for mountain bikers). This threads a winding route west through the bogs to gain a wide bealach at 724m. From here there's a sudden view to Buachaille Etive Mòr looking typically impressive.\n\nNow head up the broad ridge towards Meall a' Bhùiridh. It is grassy and featureless at this lower end, but becomes progressively steeper as you gain height; the uppermost sections are over stones and boulders. There are good views of the Creise ridge rising above the Glas Choire.\n\nEventually the slope eases and the rocky summit of Meall a'Bhùiridh is reached. Before you lies the great gulf of Coire an Easain. The views are superb; far below is the little Loch an Easain, and directly opposite are the cliffs of the Clach Leathad ridge. The vast expanse of Rannoch Moor stretches to the east, with Schiehallion clearly seen in the distance. Southeast the line of the West Highland railway is visible below the steep slopes of Beinn Achaladair.\n\nNow head west southwest down a rocky ridge to a bealach, then rises again, becoming steep and rocky, to gain the broad spine of the Creise - Clach Leathad ridge.\n\nTurn north and continue along this almost level ridge to reach the summit of Creise. Looking west the view over the Glen Etive peaks is impressive, whilst looking back south Clach Leathad appears to be almost of equal height - originally this was regarded as the Munro summit until more accurate surveys revealed Creise was the highest point.\n\nThe scree-covered slopes of Meall a'Bhùiridh to the east add drama to the view here, with Rannoch Moor still visible behind. Return by the outward route - a cairn usually marks the point where the linking ridge descends eastwards; it is necessary to climb back over Meall a' Bhùiridh.",

Inverlochlarig was the site of the final home of the celebrated outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor following his pardon; he died here in 1736 and his grave can still be visited in Balquhidder churchyard. Follow the track as it swings left and crosses the bridge over the burn.\n\nOnce over the bridge cross the stile on the right and follow the path up by the burn, passing a small hydro building and then joining the track heading north up Glen Inverlochlarig. Turn right along this, continuing until clear of the farm area and passing through a gate in a fence. There is no path up the slopes of Beinn Tulaichean; it's probably worth continuing along the track until a bend before following an ill-defined bumpy ridge to avoid some of the boggy ground at its base. From here climb to the left of a large cairn on a grassy knobble, and then continue up the slopes.\n\nAt around 500m a fence line runs across the slope - passing through a gate in this at NN426 188. Continue uphill, avoiding any broken crags; the slope eases briefly at around 700m. The ridge of the mountain becomes more defined ahead and a path helps on the final climb, which keeps left before swinging NNW to gain the ridge line. There are superb views looking back over Loch Doine and Loch Voil.\n\nA final stroll along a grassy ridge leads to the cairn atop a small rocky outcrop on the summit. The views are extensive to the southeast but rather curtailed by higher mountains in other directions, though Cruach Àrdrain and the high peaks of Ben More and Stob Binnein appear impressive. Follow the path along the ridge towards Cruach Àrdrain, descending easily to the bealach between the peaks.\n\nContinue across the bealach on the path that heads up towards Cruach Àrdrain itself. High on the ridge a small cairn marks where a path coming up from the Grey Height ridge joins in.\n\nEventually the path swings right along the summit ridge, but there's a short sharp descent and reascent before the true summit of Cruach Àrdrain is reached. The view sweeps down Coire Àrdrain to Crianlarich, and takes in a wide array of the mountain peaks of the Southern Highlands.\n\nRetrace your steps back to the bealach with Beinn Tulaichean. From here a small cairn marks the start of a path that heads down the initially grassy slopes to the east.\n\nSoon the path fades out and the descent continues down open slopes. It is rough going at times and there are some slabby rocks and broken crags to avoid on the way down.\n\nOnce down to the floor of the glen a grassy track is reached.

    "description": "Park at the large National Trust car park at the Linn of Dee; there is a charge. Before beginning the walk, it is worth heading back to the road and having a look at the Linn of Dee on the far side, where the River Dee plunges through a narrow rocky defile, spanned by the road bridge. Return to the car park, and this time take the footpath which leaves it to the north. This path through the forest has a 'boardwalk' surface in parts, and soon curves east and passes through a gate to join the main landrover track heading up Glen Lui. Turn left up this track, which soon crosses the Lui Water, leaves the forest and continues up the more empty glen.\n\nAfter a couple more kilometres the track passes below a plantation and then enters the beautiful pinewoods around Derry Lodge. This former shooting lodge is boarded up; it is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland following its purchase of the vast Mar Lodge estate. Just south of here is Bob Scott's, an open refuge for walkers; please help to maintain this by carrying out any rubbish when you pass back this way as it has been badly abused by some. Continue past Derry Lodge, forking right to pass the mountain rescue building and cross the Derry Burn via a footbridge. On the far side turn left across the flats; the path is boggy for some distance before becoming excellent once back amongst the pines. These gradually become more scattered as the route continues up Glen Luibeg.\n\nThe path forks just before an area of fenced, regenerating woodland. From here, if you have plenty of energy, you could join the route up Càrn a'Mhaim and then follow its fine arête to reach Ben Macdui. Otherwise, for the shorter, Sròn Riach route, take the right fork, which gently curves round the hillside to the right to continue up into upper Glen Luibeg, which is bare of trees. There are grand views up the glen of the route up Sròn Riach and the grand cliffs of Coire Sputan Dearg. After a couple more kilometres, the burn forks and its right branch must be crossed; this is usually straightforward but may require a detour upstream after wetter weather. Once on the far side, follow the path which begins the climb up Sròn Riach in earnest. The path is good and the climb is steady, but long. The top of Sròn Riach is a short-lived releif, as across a shallow dip the climb begins again, this time close to the edge of broken cliffs which plummet down to Lochan Uaine. Continue ascending close to the cliff edge until you reach the cairn on Coire Sputan Dearg, which is on the edge of the Macdui plateau.\n\nFrom here, break off left across the plateau, crossing another shallow dip to begin the final climb. Just short of the summit is a roofless stone shelter; this was the Sapper's bothy, built by OS surveyors in the 1840s when they were trying to calculate whether Ben Macdui or Ben Nevis was Britain's highest peak. Continue beyond this shelter to reach the large cairn, trig point and view indicator on the summit of Ben Macdui. At 1309 metres, this is now known to be the second highest point in the UK; it is reputedly haunted by a huge, shadowy apparition known as the Grey Man.\n\nThe view is extensive although the tundra-like plateau robs it of much depth. Head back towards the Coire Sputan Dearg cliffs (keeping well back from the corniced edge in winter), and this time turn left and follow the path which descends northeast, coming up from Loch Etchachan.\n\nIn the 1800s this was the pony track to the summit of Macdui, and was used by Queen Victoria when she ascended the mountain, somewhat hampered by the vast skirts of the time. Break to the right off the path to reach the bealach at 1053m below Creagan a'Choire Etchachan. You can either head up to the top of this minor peak, or skirt its southwestern flanks. Continue across the 1014 bealach between the Creagan and Derry Cairngorm itself.\n\nHead uphill across the awkward boulderfield to the ridge of Derry Cairngorm. The summit is towards the far end, and although much lower than Ben Macdui it is still a substantial peak at 1155 metres. From Deeside it is the most prominent summit of the range, and was once simply known as Cairngorm; in more recent times the 'Derry' was added to distinguish it from the Speyside Cairngorm. As might be expected, it is a fine viewpoint for Deeside, whilst Ben Macdui looks impressive above the great cliffs. Continue southeast across more boulders before reaching the good path that leads down to the bealach and across to Càrn Crom.\n\nAscend briefly to reach Carn Crom, the final rise on the end of the ridge. From here, descend southeast, still on a path, to the crags of Creag Bad an t-Seabhaig. Wind down through these to return to the pinewoods around Derry Lodge, and follow the track back to the Linn of Dee.",

With the descent on the excellent Kilbo path back to Glendoll forest at the head of Glen Clova, in summer conditions this makes a straightforward round for two Munros.",
    "description": "Start from the Glen Doll car park at the head of Glen Clova where there is a ranger information post and toilets (parking charge). From the start there is a great view of the Scorrie - the steep shoulder of Driesh that rises dramatically from the floor of the glen.\n\nFrom the car park follow the sign for Forest Walks and take the track past the farm at Acharn, keeping left at the fork here (sign Forest Walks). At the next junction ignore the track off left, following the signs for Corrie Fee. Soon Jock's Road, the ancient route to Braemar leaves to the right, stay on the main track running alongside, and soon crossing, the White Water. Keep on the track, taking the left branch when it forks. Soon the path narrows and heads into the woods.\n\nThe path winds uphill, crossing a small stream, and then reaches the deer fence at the entrance to Corrie Fee National Nature Reserve. From the viewpoint just beyond the magnificent bowl shape of the corrie is suddenly revealed, with a fine waterfall at the back.\n\nFollow the path across the undulating bottom of the corrie, the bumps are mounds of glacial debris left by the retreating glacier that carved out the corrie. The area has a large number of rare plants and it is also a good place to spot golden eagles and other birds of prey. At the back of the corrie the well-made path starts to climb steeply, keeping well to the left of the waterfall.\n\nOnce the path emerges onto the plateau it heads SSW to climb gently toward Mayar, eventually becoming an informal hill path. The Munro summit is marked with a small cairn, and a fairly extensive view across the rolling tableands of the Mounth plateau. From the summit head north northeast for a very short distance to avoid steep ground, and then follow the path (with very occasional fenceposts) eastwards.\n\nAt a tall post, the Kilbo path and a line of posts from the south come up to join the route. The path to the right leads down the Shank of Drumwhallo into Glen Prosen; continue straight ahead along the plateau, now with more regular fenceposts. This passes the south side of the top of the Shank of Drumfollow which extends northwards from the plateau. Our eventual descent route is the path that descends NNE along the right flank of the Shank, but first we have Driesh to climb. Descend slightly to reach the bealach between Corrie Kilbo and Black Skellies.\n\nBeyond the bealach a rough path climbs the initially steeper slope ahead and then continues towards the dome shaped summit area, passing a couple of small cairns before the trig point and massive shelter cairn at the summit of Driesh is reached. The views are extensive - especially towards the Firth of Tay - but the flat plateau does rob them of much depth. The route marked on some maps descending the NNE ridge via the Scorrie is very steep and poorly defined - this is really much better left as an challenging alternative ascent route. Instead, to make a safer descent retrace the outward route down to the col and part way up the other side pick up a path to the right, linking to the path down the side of the Shank of Drumfollow.\n\nThe path descends across the slope to eventually reach the forestry. It passes through a gate in a deer fence and continues descending through the forest, crossing the Burn of Kilbo on stepping stones. After a while keep straight across at a track to continue downhill. When the track is reached again turn left to follow it round a bend to the right, continuing downhill. At the next junction turn left to cross a bridge and then right to follow the original track back to the car park.",

    "summary": "This marvellous but long and arduous ridge walk is a Munro-baggers delight. Nowhere else in the Highlands can so many peaks be climbed in a day, with minimal descent between the summits, and the views are excellent all the way. However, this is a long day with steep ground on either side of the ridge - route finding skills and a fast pace are required. If in any doubt about fitness, the route can be split into two days by using the Druim na Coire nan Eirecheanach ridge to descend from the ridge at the end of the first day, and use the Druim Thollaidh ridge to regain the ridge to begin the second day.",
    "description": "The whole ridge on the south side of Glen Shiel is described as a single walk. Although a long day, this is the way most walkers tackle it. Note that this walk finishes around nine kilometres down the A87 from the start point, so you will probably want to arrange transport back up the glen, leave a bike, or try to time things for the bus service. Just east of the Cluanie Inn is the start of the old road from Cluanie to Tomdoun; it is possible to park fifty metres along this road. The walk begins by continuing along this private road soon crossing a bridge. At a fork keep right; the lower route goes to Cluanie Lodge. As the route climbs there are great views back over Loch Cluanie and the old road crosses a lovely stone bridge.\n\nContinue onwards all the way until a bealach.Even though it might feels wrong to lose height, this route is much easier going than crossing the rough pathless ground on the more direct line, so continue for another kilometre after the bealach. Just before another small bridge look out for a cairn on the right marking a stalkers path. The path climbs up zig-zags to the ridge, keep straight on where a smaller path, marked with a tiny cairn, forks left. There are great views back over Loch Loyne.\n\nThe summit of Creag a' Mhaim is the first Munro of the day at 947 metres. The most strenuous climb of the walk is now already behind, as the marvellous South Glen Shiel Ridge stretches ahead.\n\nThere is only a very short descent to the first col, after which the ridge begins to narrow on the gradual climb up to the second peak. The final section of ridge before the summit of Druim Shionnach is very narrow and rocky and can be avoided by using a bypass path just off to the left; you have now reached your second Munro at 987m.\n\nThe next peak is three kilometres further along the ridge, though the undulations are fairly gentle. There are great slabby crags sweeping down into the corries to the north, but the southern slopes are much gentler. The reward is your third Munro, Aonach air Chrith which at 1021m is the highest summit on the whole ridge. From here, most of the rest of the days ridge can be seen winding ahead. Shortly after the summit there is a narrow and rocky section of ridge (which can be bypassed) and soon a narrow grassy path enables a faster pace once more.\n\nThe ridge undulates over a couple of very minor summits before ascending to the fourth Munro, Maol Chinn-Dearg (981metres). From here the path along the ridge bypasses the top of the minor peak of Sgùrr Coire na Feinne before a long slow ascent to munro number five, Sgùrr an Doire Leathain (1010 metres).\n\nThe very summit of this mountain is a short distance along the northeast ridge and requires a slight detour NE. It has a fine view of the next peak, Sgùrr an Lochain which is the most distinctive on the whole ridge. Return to the main ridge, which now has good views down to the loch in Coire Lochain, and climbs easily up to Sgùrr an Lochain (1004 m).\n\nEnjoy the view from this sixth and finest Munro of the day before heading along the seemingly endless ridge once more. The next peak Sgùrr Beag is not a Munro and most walkers have worn a path which avoids its summit, passing to the south side, before the ridge drops to its lowest point at 729 metres with a little lochan. The climb up to the final Munro (Creag nan Dàmh) is likely to be a trial for worn-out limbs. Continue along the ridge and after a pronounced dip, take care on the short, straightforward, scramble up the far side.\n\nStay on the ridge for nearly 2km from the final peak, following the remains of a drystone dyke to the Bealach Duibh Leac where a small cairn marks where to turn north to start the steeper part of the descent. From here follow an old stalkers path, initially faint but marked by some small cairns at first, which winds down the northern slope and is boggy and rocky in places. Further down it becomes clearer and crosses, then leads down the west side of the Allt Coire Mhurlagain. Later on, keep the fence on your left and as the road in the bottom of the glen comes into view, the path forks. The main left branch leads to a ford over the burn, whilst the boggy right hand one veers away from the fence to reach an old footbridge at NG 970134. From here continue down through bracken, in the summer, to a gate leading to the A87. Now all you need to do is get back to your start point several km back up the busy road - there is a layby just to the right.",

    "description": "There is a car park just north of the house on the east side of the A835 just south of Inverlael Bridge. Start by going back out the car park entrance and then turning sharp right onto a track. Continue along the track towards the hills, with distant views towards Loch Broom to your left. Soon the track leads through a gate and into the Inverlael plantation. Ignore a track that heads off down the left and then one off up to the right. After 2km the track dips to cross a bridge over the river. Further on a track forks off left for Seana Bhràigh, one of the remotest Munros; our route continues up the main track through the forestry.\n\nAfter another kilometre a large turning area is reached, and the route continues on a path. This almost immediately exits the forestry at a gate and the walk now improves greatly as the route follows an old stalkers path up Gleann na Sguaib. Height is gained gradually on the excellent path which keeps well to the left above the burn, with grand views to Beinn Dearg ahead. After another couple of kilometres the path forks; the left path heads up towards Eididh nan Clach Geala and is used on the return, but our route keeps to the main glen path ahead.\n\nThere are impressive cliffs across the glen as Coire Mathair Lathail is reached and a burn is crossed at a confluence. The path now ascends between the two burns to eventually ascend up to Lochan Lathail, a truly beautiful spot. Beyond the lochan the path - which extends far beyond what is shown on some OS maps, despite a couple of indistinct stretches - climbs once more in a series of zig-zags to reach the barren, stony Bealach an Lochain Uaine. There is another series of small lochans here, and the bealach is the junction of several routes.\n\nOur route ascends Beinn Dearg first. To do so, head southeast across the wide bealach to meet a massive stone wall. Turn right alongside this, soon climbing steeply beside the wall and up over some bouldery ground. There are great views back over the bealach. The ascent is strenuous but the slope eventually eases; when you reach a corner where the wall turns right pass through a gap and aim slightly west of south to reach the huge summit cairn.\n\nAt 1084 metres this is the highest Munro north of the A835. The views are superb and very extensive with countless mountains in view; An Teallach is well seen to the northwest, whilst Loch Broom stretches away towards Assynt and Coigach. The photo shows the distant Torridon peaks seen over Loch a' Bhroain. Return to the wall and retrace your steps back down the steep slopes.\n\nThe second Munro to climb is Cona' Mheall. At the end of the wall, pass to the right of a small lochan and then follow a rough path that traverses the southern slopes of a hillock before descending to the east to reach a lower bealach. From here there are magnificent views south into Coire Ghranda with its fine loch. Beyond this bealach the ascent of Cona Mheall is up a wide open slope of grass and scree, with a final boulderfield before the summit, though a faint path helps avoid the worst of the boulders. For many years this was said to have been one of the only Munros with no summit cairn, but there is a small cairn at the 980 metre top today; but no man-made constructions can detract from the wild views across the Coire to the cliffs of Beinn Dearg. Retrace your steps back down to the first bealach and then back to Lochan Uaine.\n\nThis time, ascend the ridge which heads northwest from Lochan Uaine itself, ignoring a stalkers path that heads north. Keep the steep drop on your left and continue up the slope that leads easily to the third Munro of the day, Meall nan Ceapraichean. Continue over the minor bump of Ceann Garbh. The descent from here can be tricky if the best route isn't taken - head east towards a dip before cutting down. There is stony ground and boulders, and several bands of crags; eventually a path can be picked up that descends along the top of one of these lines of crags that slopes down to the next bealach.\n\nThe climb up to Eididh nan Clach Geala is on easier on mostly grassy slopes. There are two cairns - the first is the highest, but the second cairn a short distance beyond is the finest viewpoint. If you are lucky with the weather and light conditions, this fourth and lowest Munro at 928 metres is a great place to enjoy the spectacular view northwest to the mountains of Coigach and Assynt, with Stac Pollaidh prominent.\n\nContinue the walk by descending the west ridge for almost a kilometre before dropping steeply southwards to join up with a stalkers path coming down from Loch a Chnapaich, with great views back to Beinn Dearg and Meall nan Ceapraichean. Follow this stalkers path downhill until it rejoins the outward route in Gleann na Sguaib, then turn right to return to the start by the route of ascent.",

Head west up the lane back to the main A832 road, turning left and cross road. Almost immediately, by red telephone box, take old road over the stone bridge, and turn right through kissing gate (footpath sign) and follow track to water treatment hut. Pass behind the hut, through a kissing gate (footpath sign) and follow the burn, keeping to the left of the fence.\n\nAt one point the route detours around a fenced area, and eventually it is necessary to go through a gate on the right to continue up by the Allt Achadh na Sine burn on the now open hill. Ascend the grassy hillside beside the stream for almost two kilometres, where the slope eases. Meall a' Chaorainn appears to be within easy reach but the intervening ground is a huge peat bog. Eventually leave the stream to avoid going too far into the bog, heading across wet groundtowards the shoulder ahead, Creagan na Laogh.\n\nHigher up on the shoulder the ground underfoot begins to dry off at last, and superb views open up looking back towards the peaks of Torridon, with Liathach, Beinn Eighe and Slioch all prominent. From the flat top of Creagan na Laogh with its tiny cairn, continue northwards across a shallow descent to climb once more, reaching the main ridge of Fionn Bheinn.\n\nTurn left along the ridge, which descends slightly before it begins the climb to the summit. The ridge is bounded on the north by the grassy crags of Toll Mòr , the most dramatic feature of Fionn Bheinn and unsuspected in views from the road. The ridge curves slightly right to reach the summit trig point. Fionn Bheinn is 934 metres high.\n\nThere is a great view north to the Fannichs across Loch Fannich (the range to which Fionn Bheinn belongs, geologically), but the best prospect is that of the Torridon mountains from this unfamiliar angle. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the hill is its mention in the prophecies of the Brahan Seer. Unlike many of his prophecies, this is one which has not yet come to pass, nor is it clear what it means. He said - 'The day will come when a raven, attired in plaid and bonnet, will drink his fill of human blood on Fionn Bheinn, three times a day, for three successive days'.\n\nThe quickest return route is to retrace your steps. There is a worthwhile variation however. Return along the ridge, continuing east at the point where you first reached it, and soon descending to reach a well-built stone wall. Turn right along the near side of the wall to follow its course ESE and then SE down the hillside. Eventually an old grassy path is reached which runs at right-angles to the wall. Turn right down this.\n\nThe old path - a little overgrown with grasses but still distinct and marked on 1:25k maps - is built up in places and gives the best going across the boggy slopes. Eventually it passes through a gate in a deer fence, and then a second gate when it reaches the top of the Achnasheen plantation. Go through this and follow the path - very wet in places - down through the conifers. It soon emerges into a felled area - continue down across grassy pastures to the gate and the A832 road. Traffic on the road is very fast, and instead of walking on the verge it is possible instead to continue along the grassy pastures just above it, to the right of the fence. Once the edge of Achnasheen is reached cross to the other side of the road and follow the branch off to the left that leads down to the pond and railway station at the start.",

There is a good view of the day's objective, Gairich, across the waters of the loch, its craggy northeast face looking impressive.\n\nThe dam was completed in 1962 as part of one of the largest of the hydro-electric schemes which brought electricity to the Highlands for the first time; the dam is almost 320 metres long and 38 metres high, and feeds the Quoich power station further down the glen. Begin the walk by crossing the top of the dam.\n\nOnce across the dam, bear right to follow the rough and very boggy path which keeps close to the shore of the reservoir at first. After about a kilometre the path aims left (south) to climb away from the water, and passes the southern end of Lochan an-Fhigheadair and crosses the stream filling it.\n\nThe going improves as the path crosses a low bealach on the moor before descending towards the forestry below the Bealach na Faire, where it joins another old path at a gateway. Don't go through the gateway into the trees, but follow the rough path straight ahead uphill which climbs beside the forestry fence. At a stile and gate bear right to join the stalkers path up from Glen Kingie. The path, now drier and easy to walk, ascends Druim na Gaid Salaich in a series of zigzags, with good views back down Glen Kingie.\n\nThe path crosses some boggy areas and becomes just a faint peaty trail once the ridge flattens out into an extensive plateau of Bac nam Foid. Continue towards Gairich to the west; the path becomes clearer once more at the foot of the steeper slopes.\n\nThe stalkers path keeps well to the left of the ridge at first before zig-zagging sharply to the right to ascend to the foot of the steep nose. The original stalkers path shown on OS maps as heading left here cannot be seen on the ground anymore. Follow the main path worn by Munro-baggers to continue up the ridge.\n\nThe east ridge of Gairich is very steep higher up and there is one section of very simple scrambling up knobbly rock; a false summit is passed before the true summit comes into view. The large cairn is at 919 metres on a small plateau, making Gairich one of the smallest of the Munros. The isolated position makes it a superb viewpoint however, particularly for the vast waters of Loch Cuaich and into Knoydart and the Glendessary mountains to the west.\n\nThe easiest return is to retrace your steps all the way back by the same route.",

There is a new car park here. Follow the track that is the continuation of the road, forking right at the junction, signed for Tomdoun and Morar. At the next junction ignore the turning where the Tomdoun route heads off up to the right and keep on the main route, which runs close to the River Dessary and then leads past Glendessary Farm and the gateway to the modern Glendessary Lodge, before continuing to Upper Glendessary.\n\nTurn right onto a footpath just before Upper Glendessary, signed for Inverie. After just a few metres the path turns left, and runs across the hillside towards the top corner of the forestry. This historic route then traverses the hills just above the trees. The way crosses some small burns and can be boggy in places. Continue on the path to reach the larger Allt Coire nan Uth. The path crosses this some way above the forest (in spate conditions, there's a bridge at the top of the forestry). Once across, bear off to the right, where a small cairn indicates the start of a path which climbs up the steep slopes which become the south ridge of Sgùrr nan Coireachan.\n\nThe climb is mostly on very steep grass interspersed with rocks; it seems to get ever steeper as height is gained. Eventually it eases at a shoulder at around 800m, then rises again to a minor top before the final ridge which gives a pleasant traverse to the summit of Sgùrr nan Coireachan at 953m - the first Munro of the day, with a great outlook along Loch Quoich.\n\nThere's an even more wonderful panorama of the more rugged mountains along the ridge ahead. From here, the descent is very steep in places; it heads down to the west and then southwest to reach the Bealach Coire nan Gall. There are a few old fenceposts on the way down. From the bealach, the first steep section of the climb beyond is tackled to the left of a drystone dyke.\n\nContinue on the path, often accompanied by the wall (though this relents at some rockier section). The route climbs steeply and then begins a traverse of Garbh Chioch Bheag to reach the larger Garbh Chioch Mhor. The going is exceptionally rough with many steep ascents and descents and twists and turns to avoid rocky obstacles. It will probably take longer than expected to reach the cairn on this second Munro. The views along the ridge, particularly down into the corrie on the north, are as wild and rugged as anywhere in Scotland.\n\nContinue following the wall down steeply down to the bealach below the impressive final cone of Sgùrr na Cìche. The bealach is known as 'Feadan na Cìche' - the whistle of the breast (after its parent peak), and the wind can certainly tear through here. The ascent ahead looks formidable with much rock but there is a path which winds its way to the left at first before cutting back in zigzags towards the summit.\n\nSgùrr na Cìche's cone is the third and highest of the day's Munros and one of the shapeliest summits in Britain, though the summit area is larger and grassier than expected. It is one of those mountains that is easily identified in distant views; now you've managed to climb, it gives a magnificent view down the length of Loch Nevis. Return to the last bealach before descending to the southwest.\n\nThe way soon leads down into a gorge-like ravine; this part of the descent is steep and requires minor scrambling - and great care. Further down the gully opens out once more; continue down to below the steepest ground before bearing left (southeast) across a shoulder of Garbh Chioch Mhor. The path - faint in places - then descends more steeply again, eventually meeting a rough ATV track. Turn left down this, eventually it meets the path path from Sourlies at the head of Loch Nevis to Glendessary. Turn left along this path to continue down the glen.\n\nBefore reaching the forestry there's a choice of routes; the old stalking path keeps left just above the trees to eventually rejoin the outward route. Alternatively you can aim towards the stile that leads into trees in the glen floor. Once in the forest a rough track reaches and then follows the River Dessary, later crossing it at an old bridge. On the far side the track gives much better going, eventually emerging into a more open section. Continue on the track into the next block of forestry. A' Chùil Bothy is just off to the north of the track where it enters the trees; if visiting, follow the bothy code. Continue through the forest for another four kilometres to a junction with another track; turn left here to cross the river at Strathan and return to the start.

When the track forks, keep left, passing to the left of a small reservoir. Follow the track to the southern end of Lochan na h-Earba, crossing the bridge over its feeder stream. There is a stunning sandy beach on the left just beyond looking up the deep trench-like glen holding the two lochs.\n\nThe main track now runs along the head of the loch before swinging to the right in a loop. Look out for a small cairn that indicates the start of a grassy path which is a short-cut to the main stalkers path you now need to follow. Join this and follow it uphill; it soon runs alongside the Allt Coire Pitridh. The surface has been improved in places and the path is almost as good as a track. Pass some ruined shielings and higher up cross a feeder stream coming down from the east. About half a kilometre further up, leave this excellent path and cross the Allt Coire Pitridh, heading up the steep grassy bank on the far side. The ground ahead is boggy in places; make a bee-line across it to the south. Beyond climb the initially very steep slopes ahead, bearing a little to the right to reach the eastern rim of Coire Mòr Chlachair higher up. The corrie is quite a dramatic scoop out of the mountain and the summit of Beinn a'Chlachair comes into view across it.\n\nContinue round the rim of the corrie, passing to the left (or over) a rocky wart prominent in some distant views. The ground is a mixture of loose stones and grassy patches and the slope becomes easier as it finally merges into the spacious plateau of Beinn a'Chlachair. The summit is at the far side of the corrie; there is briefly a path before the final stony slopes are reached leading to the large cairn with a windshelter on the northwest side. At 1087 metres this is the highest of the three Munros and the view is probably the most extensive. Chno Dearg is the nearest prominent peak to the west, backed by the impressive Easains and the Grey Corries. South is the very remote Aonach Beag range whilst to the east are the two peaks making up the rest of the days walk - Geal Chàrn looks (and is!) a long way from here. Head back down the stony slope and then continue across the plateau towards it - there is a path on the grassy sections though it is lost on the stones.\n\nThe plateau ends abruptly in cliffs above Loch a'Bhealaich Leamhain. The descent is to the north, either directly down the corner of the slopes towards the Bhealach Leamhain - which is very steep and rocky, requiring some scrambling and route finding, or a couple of hundred metres further west where the descent to the north is just as steep but grassier. If taking this latter option, once easier ground is reached you can traverse to the right to meet the stalkers path from the bealach rather than continuing directly down over the bogs. Follow the path to the left to reach the stalkers path junction of Coire Pitridh.\n\nHere turn right to trace the excellent path heading north over the col between Creag Pitridh and Geal Chàrn. Stay on this path for around half a kilometre until it begins to traverse the slopes and a convenient place is reached to leave it and head directly for Geal Chàrn. The slopes are easy at first with a few stony sections higher up. There are a couple of false summits - Geal Chàrn seems further than might be expected - but eventually the true summit comes into view ahead. This has its own name - Mullach Coire an Iubhair - and consists of a small stony cone topped with a very well-built cairn (and a trig point behind); a fine summit for such a sprawling mountain. The best parts of the view are back to Beinn a'Chlachair and the more distant view east towards the Cairngorms. Return back along the ridge before diverting to the right to reach the bealach below Creag Pitridh. This peak looks tiny compared to its mighty neighbours - a mere bump on the slopes of Geal Chàrn, but on closer acquaintance it begins to look very steep.\n\nAt the bealach the stalkers path is reached once more; cross over it. Luckily there is a path up Creag Pitridh, making the ascent much more straightforward; this aims straight for the top at first before dog-legging left and then finally to the right across quartzite rocks to the summit. Although only 924 metres it has perhaps the most beautiful view of the three Munros, with the two Lochan na h-Earba and Loch Laggan prominent. For the descent, follow a path at first to the west which leads down the steeper upper section. Once the flatter shoulder is reached bear left off the ridge to make a long descent of straightforward, mostly grassy slopes. Aim for the confluence where the stream from the bealach meets the Allt Coire Pitridh - this avoids boggy ground further east. At the confluence the stalkers path from the outward route is joined. Turn right along this and retrace your steps all the way back to the start.",

    "description": "Start from the parking area on the left just before Garva Bridge, some distance up the minor road past the Spey dam. The double-span stone bridge was built by General Wade as part of his route over the Corryairack Pass. This is a lonely piece of countryside, with vast herds of red deer; apart from the Munro-baggers heading for this summit there are few visitors. Cross the bridge and then take the next right turn up a track which leads off north from the road. It reaches a new track used in the construction of the Beauly-Denny pylon line; turn right on this, crossing a bridge over the Allt Coire Iain Oig, and then left onto a track on the far side. Almost immediately cross the wire fence on the left - either stepping over or under - and then follow the grassy banks of the river upstream.\n\nThere is only a faint path at first but it soon becomes clearer. Continue beside the Feith Talagain until after passing through a gap in a fence. After this the path keeps higher above the burn, crossing boggy moorland. After around a kilometre another fence is crossed at a style, and further on the route reaches the Allt Coire nan Dearcag above where it joins the main stream. Continue up the path up the near side of the Allt Corie nan Dearcag.\n\nUnless the burn is in high spate, soon cross and follow the path up the broad indistinct ridge leading up towards Geal Chàrn; at other times it is possible to continue up beside the burn to find an easier crossing place higher up. Either way, the route leads up to the top of a flattish shoulder southwest of Geal Chàrn is reached, by which point there are fine views looking back towards the hidden side of the Creag Meagaidh group across the glen, and glimpses towards the Loch Laggan Munros.\n\nContinue north east for a steady pull until the flatter plateau is reached. The massive cairn marking the summit is around 700m further across the plateau. At 926 metres this is the fourth of the Monadhliath Munros; there is a vast, featureless wilderness extending to the north.\n\nThe easiest descent is to return the same way. There is an alternative route, but it does involve a crossing of the Markie Burn and should only be attempted during dry weather. For this route (Grade 4) continue northeast round Geal Chàrn's most impressive feature, the corrie holding Lochan a'Choire. Once beyond the last of the crags a descent can be made southeast to join the Piper's Burn much lower down. Cross the Markie Burn near the confluence - which can be impossible in spate - and follow the track down the far side to the Spey dam. To complete the circuit turn right and return to Garva Bridge along the road.",

The route described here is from Culra bothy which is closed but you can camp nearby; the setting is beautiful and accessed via a long walk-in from Dalwhinnie.",
    "description": "This route begins from Culra bothy; the walk in from Dalwhinnie to Culra is described separately. Culra bothy is closed due to the presence of asbestos so it is necessary to carry a tent and camp nearby. From Culra a faint path starts up the slope to the west towards Càrn Dearg, soon petering out. Continue up the steep heather slopes to the northwest; the going can be eased slightly by following the line of a grassy gully which is usually dry. When the slope eases, continue across rough ground until curving left to gain the ridge leading up towards Càrn Dearg, which gives much better going.\n\nThe summit of Càrn Dearg has fine views, with Ben Alder and its Leachas ridges having pride of place. Descend west; the ground soon becomes grassy as the route continues across a bealach and crosses the minor Top of An Diollaid. The ridge then descends to a second, lower bealach with some fine scenery.\n\nTo the right Coire Cheap with a circular lochan, whilst on the left the larger Loch an Sgoir is cradled by the spectacular Lancet Edge, whilst the route continues up steep Aisre Ghobhainn, with a path avoiding any problems. It emerges suddenly on a spacious, undulating grassy plateau. In poor conditions it could be difficult to locate the summit, which is marked by a small cairn around a kilometre WSW. From here, it is possible to shorten the walk, either by heading for the Lancet Edge for an exposed scrambly descent, or by heading for the Bealach Dubh.\n\nTo continue the walk to the next two Munros, follow the edge of the plateau WSW; it soon narrows and becomes an obvious ridge as it leads on to a high bealach at 1016 metres. The ascent to dome-like summit of Aonach Beag is short and straightforward; again the summit is marked by a small cairn.\n\nFollow the southwest ridge easily down to the next bealach. The descent route back for Culra leaves from here, but before taking it there is still Beinn Èibhinn to ascent. The first part of this climb is a little steeper, with some rocks, but there are no difficulties. After a slight dip the ridge rises more gently to the first of two summits, marked with the same height on OS 1:25 000 mapping; the second of them is regarded as the Munro, the fourth of the day.\n\nReturn back down the ridge to the last bealach. From here a faint path angles south to avoid some scree to reach grassier ground. Descend into Coire a'Charra Bhig, crossing and then keeping to the left of the stream. Before the bogs at the foot of the corrie are reached traverse the rough slopes to the left, keeping below the crags of Sròn Ruadh but above the peat. Once beyond the bogs drop down to the Allt Coire a'Laobhair and head for the stalkers path a short distance up the far slope. This is superbly maintained; turn left and follow it as it climbs over the Bealach Dubh. From here the path continues for a further 5.5km before reaching Culra bothy once more, crossing the Allt Loch an Sgoir along the way.",

    "description": "Begin at the parking area on the left just before Balsporran Cottages off the west side of the A9. The cottages are situated in an extremely bleak spot at 425 metres - in winter this is as cold as spot as you will find in Britain. Pass the cottages and cross the level crossing over the railway beyond, continuing along the track. Note the state of the burn on the left at this point, as the route crosses this right at the end. Ignore the first main track forking right, instead continuing to reach a tributary burn, crossing this via a bridge.\n\nSoon after this look out for another track forking to the right. Take this; it becomes better made for a time before eventually being succeeded by a path. Continue up the heathery slopes with improving views back over Drumochter.\n\nContinue to the flat shoulder where a set of once mighty cairns stood. Only one of the original cairns remains, though a set of more makeshift neighbours has appeared including a shelter cairn. The path peters out for a time on the flat shoulder beyond.\n\nThe summit of Geal Chàrn is an easy kilometre beyond. Although an undistinguished Munro and one of the easiest to reach, the cairn at the summit has a grand view over Loch Ericht to Ben Alder. To the south can be seen the more shapely hill of A' Mharconaich.\n\nDescend southwest and then south to reach the wide bealach at 739 metres, with superb views along the length of Loch Ericht throughout the descent.\n\nThere's a track across the bealach which is followed for around 350m to the right, before tackling the clear path off left to head up the broad slopes beyond. When the ground levels out turn left along the broad, plateau-like ridge; there continue to be stunning views behind to Ben Alder.\n\nContinue northeast across the plateau to reach the summit cairn; the area on the final approach is covered by areas of matting intended to help secure vegetation - it looks very odd in aerial photographs. The first part of the descent from the summit is the steepest part of the day; descend northwards down a spur, with a steep corrie on the right; this requires care under the winter conditions when these hills are popular.\n\nThe spur flattens out before steepening again as it curves round to the northeast. Continue down the now gentler ridge. Lower down the path becomes very boggy. You can either continue along it and cross the burn to rejoin the route by the private crossing, or if you think the burn is high then it may be better to bear left earlier to join the track from the bealach. On the far side follow the track back over the level crossing to pass Balsporran Cottages and return to the car park.",

Head down this track and over the bridge over the picturesque River Etive. Beyond this a junction is reached - keep right here and follow the hydro track. At Coiletir a sign indicates a path round the cottage to the left, but it's much easier walking to stay on the hydro track that bypasses it to the right. Eventually the track reaches the Allt Mheuran.\n\nContinue to the bridge, then turn left onto a boggy path on the far side, following the burn uphill; avoid the scar on the right left from the tempoary hydro track. After approximately half a kilometre, leave the main path to begin the ascent up the north ridge of Ben Starav. Head southwest up this ridge; there is a path but the going is rough and steep as well as sometimes wet. The angle of the ridge eases between around 400 and 500 metres, beyond which the ridge becomes better defined and drier, although bouldery, and there is a path to help which begins climbing steeply. The views back up Glen Etive are superb.\n\nThe ridge levels off once more at about 800 metres, where another ridge joins in from the northwest. Follow the combined ridge southwards; it undulates at first before narrowing considerably; the final climb is over rocky and boulders.\n\nThe disintegrating cyclindrical trig point on the summit will be reached with some relief after the long climb. At 1078 metres this is the highest Munro in the local area; the view of Loch Etive, backed by Ben Cruachan, is quite sensational.\n\nFollow the ridge beyond the summit as it curves around, keeping the steep drop on your left, to reach the southeast summit. It can be tricky in mist to find the start of the ridge which descends steeply at first towards Stob Coire Dheirg. The ridge soon narrows to a fine rocky arete. It is possible to continue along the crest with simple scrambling - alternatively you can bypass the rocks by descending a little to the right and traversing beneath the top of the ridge.\n\nEither way, Stob Coire Dheirg, a Top, will be reached; at this point do not follow the false ridge to the north; the true ridge veers to the right, just south of east, with dramatic crags on its left flank. Soon the rockier section is left behind and further down the ridge broadens out and the awkwardly named col of Bealachan Lochain Ghaineamhaich is reached.\n\nThe energetic may detour southeast from here and include an extra Munro, Beinn nan Aighenan, in the day's itinerary. This involves an extra downhill section before a long climb and then an energy-sapping return to this point. Less energetic walkers will continue up the ridge to the east instead. The ridge winds to and fro and ascends the steep minor peak of Meall na Tri Tighearean before descending slightly and then climbing once more up to Glas Bheinn Mhor.\n\nGlas Bheinn Mhor is the second Munro of the day at 997 metres. Descend down the path on the grassy east ridge, which curves to the left before descending to the next bealach at 738 metres.\n\nFrom here, turn left down the glen, keeping on the right of the stream. There is a path, but the going is boggy at times. Continue down the east bank. At around NN138457 an extremely boggy path forks right to follow a fenceline back to Coiletir, but it's preferable to simply follow a fainter path by the burn to rejoin the outward route at the hydro track.

    "description": "Park at the layby on the east side of the A93, about two kilometres north of the Glenshee Ski Centre. Do not head for the arched wooden bridge, instead following a rougher path down to the grass-covered old stone bridge which was once part of the military road from Perth to Braemar. Soon the route becomes simply a path, but the going also becomes a little drier underfoot. The path is hard to follow in parts, passing two sets of old shielings.\n\nAfter the second set of shielings the path reaches a tributary burn; head up beside this briefly before finding a good crossing place. A rough path now continues towards the stony dome of Càrn an Tuirc. The climb is initially through grass and heather, and then the path peters out in a boggy section. Higher up, it is possible to avoid most of the stones. There are great views back towards the Cairnwell Pass.\n\nThe summit cairn and adjacent small shelter cairn sit together on the flat plateau at 1019 metres; this first of the day's Munros has a great feeling of space though the plateau robs the panorama of much depth; the Cairngorms look fine across Deeside. Head east towards a subsidary cairn then ESE, descending gently to reach a grassy track.\n\nIf the weather is good, it is worth diverting to try to get a view down into Coire Loch Kander, a classic mountain corrie in total contrast to the plateau. Otherwise, to continue the walk, follow the grassy track SSE towards Cairn of Claise, initially across truly featureless grassy terrain. Eventually the track fades out near the end of a drystone wall on the right - follow the wall, which marks the old county boundary. The going now becomes stonier underfoot; the summit cairn at 1064m is just on the left side of the wall. Head southwest along the broad ridge, initially beside the stone wall.\n\nSoon it is possible to diverge from the wall to pick up a track just to the left of a tiny lochan. The track west, then southwest, then south, eventually cutting across the east side of Glas Maol. Leave it at a suitable point (there may be a tiny cairn) to ascend directly to reach the large cairn and triangulation pillar atop Glas Maol. At 1068 metres, this is the highest of the day's Munros; the plateau extends for miles to the east and north, eventually merging with Lochnagar.\n\nVery easy but featureless grassy terrain is crossed SW towards a prominent cairn at Bathach Beag. From here a wall is followed southwards along the now better defined ridge. At the bealach there is a tiny stone shelter on the east side of the wall - barely enough to accommodate a sheep! From here the walk acquires more character, and rockier slopes take over on the ascent to Cul Riabhach, and then ascends to the stony summit of Creag Leacach, the lowest but finest of the four Munros at 987 metres.\n\nFrom here there is a choice of routes. Under snow the route we describe crosses a very steep avalanche prone slope on a path which is likely to be banked out - at such times it is better to descend SW from Creag Leachach to the SW Top, then down to the bealach with Meall Gorm before heading NE down to the Allt Coire a' Bhathaich, returning to the start with a tiring road walk over the Cairnwell Pass. In summer though, the quickest and most pleasant option is probably to retrace your steps back to the cairn at Bathach Beag, and then follow an initially very faint, narrow path that contours the west side of Glas Maol - initially across grassy slopes but later across the steep slope.\n\nThis leads out onto the Meall Odhar ridge, where a zig-zag path coming down from the summit of Glas Maol is joined. Follow this to the left to reach the top of the ski tows. From here a track leads down through the upper part of the ski area, reaching a peat-hagged bealach where there are several buildings which are part of the ski centre. Continue on the track down to the top of the Cairnwell Pass. From here it's around 2.5km walk northwards downhill alongside the busy road to the return to the start.",

    "description": "There is a parking area at the start of the private drive to the Dalmunzie Castle Hotel. The first two kilometres of the walk is along the drive to the hotel itself; alternatively the walk can be shortened by paying to park at the hotel itself by calling at reception. The hotel is a magnificent baronial mansion; on reaching it continue on the track which passes it to the right and leads towards Glenlochsie Farm. Use the detour to bypass the farmyard using marker posts through the field on the left, soon rejoining the track west up Glen Lochsie. The track crosses the river at NO079717 - if the river is low you can remain on the track which crosses back again later. Alternatively the crossings can be avoided by following a sharp zig-zag to the right and then back left at a higher level.\n\nThis is the line of an old railway which was built to bring down stone for extensions to Dalmunzie Castle in 1921. The line remained in use for sporting guests up until the 1970s and there are still some old concrete sleepers along the way as well as a bridge over a substantial burn coming down the hillside. A second burn has had its bridge washed away and must be forded. Just beyond this, above the ruins of Glenlochsie Lodge, the bulldozed track joins back in from the left. Follow this track as it winds up the slope onto the broad ridge of Breac-reidh.\n\nThe track continues right up onto the dome of Glas Tulaichean, detracting greatly from the feeling of being out in the hills, but the views are extensive. At its highest point leave the main track and head to the right for a short distance to reach the summit, passing a small cairn before reaching the trig point marking the Munro summit. In clear conditions there are good views down into the craggier ground of the Ghlas Choire just to the east.\n\nDescend northeast at first around the rim of this corrie, then at the shoulder aim north to keep to the left of another corrie - Glas Choire Bheag - and avoid descending the ridge between them.\n\nWhen the boggy ground beneath Mam nan Càrn comes into view ahead aim northwest on the final steeper descent to pick up a stalkers path across the boggier slopes just on the far side of the bealach. Follow this path to the 771 metre bealach beneath Càrn an Rìgh. From here leave the path to tackle the slopes opposite; the ascent is made less steep by keeping a little to the left at first before the final more direct climb to the summit across short grass and stones. Càrn an Rìgh may be the lower of the two peaks at 1029 metres but it is in the heart of some truly wild country, and has a fine view of Beinn a'Ghlò to the west.\n\nRetrace your steps to the bealach and along the stalkers path below Mam nan Carn. This peters out into a bog, but soon appears again, aiming for the south side of Loch nan Eun. The loch is surprisingly extensive, a lonely and atmopheric place at almost 800m.\n\nFrom here there is a good view down the length of Gleann Taitneach, the route of descent. Keep to the left of the stream down the first steep section, using a boggy path. A bulldozed track can then be picked up after about a kilometre and a half. This fords the Allt Elrig side stream to continue down the glen.\n\nThe steep-sided glen gives a long but pleasant walk back towards Dalmunzie. Leave the track at NO089723 to cross a recently rebuilt footbridge over the Allt Ghlinn Thaitneach. Once across, follow a path down the west bank; this rejoins the outward route close to the Dalmunzie Hotel.

Begin by heading back east along the road for 400m until a small cairn marks the start of another stalkers' path, this time for Spidean Mialach. The boggy path looks unpromising at first as it climbs through a tunnel of rhododendron but it soon reaches open countryside and climbs gently up the hillside to the right and passing beneath electricity pylons.\n\nThe route continues to gain height into the somewhat soggy Coire Mheil; keep to the path and cross the Allt Coire Mheil. The path now slopes uphill to reach the Allt Coire Dubh and heads up alongside this stream until it forks. Cross here and follow the now very faint path aiming for the slopes of Spidean Mialach, just north of the bealach above Loch Fearna which comes into view. Aim directly for the ridge aiming to reach it just before Spidean Mialach, the climb is steep but most of the stony areas higher up can be avoided. Once on the ridge bear right to reach the summit.\n\nThe large summit cairn is perched right on the edge of the dramatic northern cliffs. At 996 metres it is the smaller of the day's two Munros. Leave the summit by heading southwest at first along the ridge, there is a small path.\n\nThe route now becomes much more dramatic, as the ridge has a series of steep rocky corries on its northern side, looking across to the South Glen Shiel ridge. Keep close to this cliff edge as the ridge heads gently northwest at first bending left and then right on a steeper descent down to the Fiar Bhealaich at 735m.\n\nFrom the bealach, a stalkers path winds its way up the steep slopes opposite; the climb eases twice before reaching the Top of Creag Coire na Fiar Bhealaich. From here the ridge descents gently before a final rocky climb to the large cairn on Gleouraich, at 1035m the second Munro of the day.\n\nAfter enjoying the extensive views of Kintail and into Knoydart, continue along the ridge, which soon turns sharply to the left (southwest) and descends onto a fine stalkers path once more.\n\nThe path descends to a flattish shoulder with a great view across Loch Quoich to Sgùrr na Cìche, before descending just below the top of the Druim Seilleach ridge on the west side.\n\nThis section of stalkers path is absolutely fantastic, with a tremendous feeling of space given by the very steep drop to the northern arm of Loch Quoich far below. Further down the path runs back onto the ridge and descends the Sròn a Chuillin in a series of zigzags. It then heads downhill southeast towards the Allt Coire Peitireach and returns to the road after a short, boggy section through dense rhododendrons, to emerge opposite the parking area.",

The track soon becomes boggy; after around half a kilometre further a hill path heads left to begin the ascent. This is a steep grind of over 700m, though a worn path helps with zig-zags on the steepest parts. There is compensation in the ever improving view back down Gleann Fionnlighe.\n\nThe slope eases to a minor top at 855m, before a very slight descent to a couple of tiny lochans. Continue up a rockier ridge to reach the trig point on the south summit of Gulvain.\n\nIn misty conditions, it's easy to mistake the trig point for the summit - especially if using the Landranger Map which shows this trig point but has the main summit on an adjacent sheet. In clear conditions it is obvious that there is a higher summit over a kilometre further. The connecting ridge narrows and gives a very fine traverse with no difficulties.\n\nA final ascent leads to the true summit of Gulvain, marked by a large cairn.Gulvain's isolated position makes it a superb viewpoint for the whole region of West Lochaber, with lochs and mountains in every direction as far as the eye can see.\n\nUnless you are intent on a walk ending many miles from where you started, the return is to retrace your route of ascent.",

This circuit visits the base of the pinnacle but does not include the ascent, which is a rock-climb. Even omitting the pinnacle, this is an extremely rough walk with a great deal of rocky terrain, some scrambling and very tricky route-finding.",
    "description": "Park opposite the Glen Brittle Memorial hut, which is just beyond the mountain rescue building as you head down Glen Brittle towards the sea. The walk begins 50m further down the road towards the beach; turn left onto a big clear footpath alongside some sheep pens. The path soon leads to a bridge over the Allt Coire na Banachdich; cross this and continue uphill on the path. Further on, the path passes close to the rim of a great bowl, with a fabulous view of the impressive Eas Mòr falls tumbling into the tree-filled gorge.\n\nShortly after the gorge take the left fork, following the clear path slightly downhill and first, and then on up into the corrie. The path becomes rougher and rockier, keeping to the right side of the corrie to climb a broad stony gully. Emerge from this into upper Coire na Banachdich, with the high cliff of Window Buttress looming above you. The back of the coire is blocked by cliffs, split by an impressive gully (the ascent of which is a serious rockclimb). After crossing the burn turn right alongside it, keeping to the left bank. As the ground steepens, zigzag left up the broken slabby rocks and scree, to pass high above the stream where it flows in a gorge. There are very occasional small cairns.\n\nKeep working up the broken rocky slopes, eventually bearing right of the corrie headwall. Just to the right of here a wide stony gully comes down. Head up this gully (occasional cairns), which narrows higher up. Near the top turn right on a worn path across the crag, then continue up more broken ground when it becomes easier again. The way up onto the ridge is again blocked by cliffs; begin traversing left, keeping below these cliffs. Continue traversing across rocky and scree-covered ground for some distance, ignoring the obvious steep scree gully heading up the cliffs.\n\nAt one point it becomes necessary to descend slightly to pass below a crag. Beyond this cross some boulders and then head right towards the lowest point on the whole ridge, the Bealach Coire na Banachdich. The bealach, at 851m, is (amazingly) the easiest pass between Glen Brittle and Loch Coruisk. It is a very narrow gully with steep rocks on both sides, and has orange soil. If the bealach you have reached doesn't have orange soil, you're probably at a second bealach slightly to the north; go back a very short distance down the scree and then back up to the left to reach the true bealach shown in the photo.\n\nThere is a short scramble out of the bealach up the right hand wall; there is a staircase of good footholds though the rocks are often wet. Above this the going becomes much easier; the ridge narrows briefly and there are great views of the steep north face of Sgùrr Dearg before a clear path begins zigzagging up the broad scree slope beyond. This path emerges suddenly at the summit of Sgùrr Dearg, with the startling sight of the Inaccessible Pinnacle ('In Pinn' to its friends) directly ahead. This is a great spot to watch climbers abseiling down the steep west side, which is a Very Difficult rock-climb.\n\nThe east ridge is much longer but less steep, being a Moderate rockclimb with incredible exposure, the ridge being less than a foot wide 'with an overhanging and infinite drop on one side, and steeper and further on the other' as the Victorian climbers had it. The first ascent was made in 1880 by the Pilkington Brothers, two of the leading mountaineers of the day. The Pinnacle is still the hardest mountain summit to reach in the British Isles, and is the only Munro that calls for rockclimbing skills and equipment. If you are not a rock-climber, you can't even think of attempting the In Pinn without help from a mountain guide or a rock-climbing friend, and ropes, harnesses etc.\n\nOur descent route heads down the West Ridge. Follow a path on the right side of the crest of the ridge at first; soon it returns to the crest. Slightly further along, descend an easy gully on the left side of the ridge, taking you down to another clear path, now contouring across the left (E) side of the ridge. The path has a slightly exposed section but is clear to follow for a short distance before another descent down broken rocks to the left leads to another clear section of path. This path descends a very short and easy gully before continuing along the side of the ridge, eventually emerging back near the top of Sgùrr Dearg Beag.\n\nThe views across Coire Lagan to Sgùrr Alasdair (with the Great Stone Chute looking unclimbable) are magnificent, as are the vistas of the Small Isles, Eigg, Rum and Canna. The easiest descent from Sgùrr Dearg Beag is again on the left side; it is possible to see a clear section of path from just below the crest of the ridge. Descend to this path and continue down it, crossing a few slabby rocks and a good deal of broken ground. The scrambling is now behind, and the path continues zigzagging down the steep slope towards the flat ground above Window Buttress.\n\nThe ridge bends slightly left here to descend again down to the final point on the ridge, the bump of Sròn Dearg above Loch an Fhir bhallaich. From Sròn Dearg continue along the ridge. At a steep section the path keeps just to the right side. Once easier ground is thankfully reached at last, a clear path leads down to join the outward route above Eas Mòr. From here retrace your steps back to the start.",

    "description": "From the landing pier in Inverie, turn right along the road passing the Old Forge pub, the tea room and shop as well as a memorial to the Seven Men of Knoydart - land-raiders who staked out claims for crofts on Knoydart after World War 2; they lost their case but won massive public sympathy. Continue through the woodland until the road bends right and a track continues ahead - take the track, which is signed as a right of way to Kinlochhourn and Strathan. It climbs through the trees to reach another junction; fork right here through the gate, continuing on a track along the top of the forestry and then slightly downhill, through an open stretch and then another brief block of forest. Further on there is a prominent memorial up to the left - this was placed here by Lord Brocket to commemorate his father. A Nazi-sympathiser, Brocket was Laird here at the time of the land raids.\n\nIgnore the track which branches off for Gleann Meadail and continue towards Loch an Dubh-Lochain. The ascent from the track up to the Mam Suidheig is steep in places, rough and partially bracken-covered in summer; there is no clear path and it is every man for himself. The bealach, which is wide and peaty, will be reached with some releif. Now follow the ridge to the east towards Aonach Sgoilite; there are only traces of a path but the views get better and better, especially looking back along the ridge. A grassy rake on the left with a faint path bypasses point 636m before rejoining the ridge on the climb beyond.\n\nAt the top of the next rise (point 758m) the ridge divides into two arms. The easiest route heads through the gap between them and continues down the grassy gully beyond; the left hand branch of the ridge ends in crags and should be avoided. Once down the gully it is easy to traverse right and regain the ridge crest. On the next ascent a low crag is avoided on the left before the ridge leads up to the broad grassy summit and tiny cairn at 849m.\n\nAt this point the route to Ladhar Bheinn from Barrisdale Bay joins in. Follow the now clearer path northwest; the initially grassy slope soon steepens and the path leads down to the Bealach Coire Dhorrcail. From here the route climbs steeply; there are a couple of short, very straightforward scrambly sections before the slope eases and the path continues across a series of knobbly bumps. There are dramatic glimpses down into Coire Dhorrcail on the right; the crags are impressive but too vegetated for much summer climbing.\n\nThere is one final awkward move needed up a rocky band - a very big step for some walkers that would be much easier in descent - or a more exposed series of smaller ledges to the left. Above this the route climbs steeply but on a path up the largely grassy ridge to suddenly reach the east summit with a tiny cairn. There are sensational views back along the ridge as well as down to Barrisdale and Loch Hourn. At this point the Stob a Choire Odhar ridge - the final arm of the circuit of Coire Dhorrcail from Barrisdale Bay - goes off to the right.\n\nThe true summit is a short distance further along the ridge at the next cairn, and enjoys what must be one of the finest views amongst the Munros. Setting the seal on perfection is the wide expanse of the sea, with the Cuillin of Skye and Rum prominent. The third summit, topped by a broken trig point, is a short distance further; continue along the ridge as it begins to descend easily at first and then more steeply.\n\nContinue along the ridge until the bealach just short of the lochan, and then aim southwest down the steep and rocky slopes of Coire Garbh. The slope gradually eases and a clear but boggy path continues down, passing to the left of the conifer plantations to join the path downriver, passing the ruins at Folach. Pass through a gate and cross the bridge to reach a landrover track. Follow the track west, reaching and climbing gently through some more forestry. When it emerges at a t-junction at Folach gate, turn left on the track and follow it through the Mam Uidhe. On the far side it descends through forestry to return to Inverie; keep straight ahead at a cross-tracks to emerge near the Old Forge pub.",

    "description": "Park at the large car park at the end of the public road up Glen Muick; there is a charge. Note that on busy weekends the car park can become full and at such times the road up Glen Muick is closed - so arrive early or plan an alternative. Continue along the track to the Spittal of Glen Muick, where there is a small wooden visitor centre and public toilets. The route to Lochnagar turns up the track to the right here. Follow this across the flat floor of Glen Muick, soon crossing a bridge over the River Muick. At the far side of the glen, fork left onto a path that reaches the forestry surrounding the Balmoral Estate's various buildings at Allt-na-guibhsaich. Go across a track to follow the path up through the woods to gain the track which ascends beside the stream.\n\nAfter just under a kilometre of ascent the track crosses to the north side of the Allt na Guibhsaich; this is usually straightforward to cross. Pass above the minor gorge of Clais Rathadan and curve round to the right.\n\nFurther on, take the clear path which branches off from the track to the left - this is the main path for Lochnagar, and has been much improved in recent years by stone-pitching. Follow the path as it climbs towards the bealach (col) visible between the main bulk of Lochnagar on the left, and its outlying peak of Meikle Pap. The path passes a memorial to Bill Stuart, a climber who died on the cliffs in 1953. As you approach the bealach, the main Lochnagar path diverts off to the left, but it is really worth continuing ahead to the bealach itself. Here, the massive but gentle and stony hills of the walk so far are replaced by a view across Lochnagar's famous northern corrie, a magnificent curve of buttresses cradling a lochan.\n\nIf you have the energy, you can divert up to the summit of Meikle Pap to the right for the best view, which ranks as a Scottish classic.\n\nYou can now either retrace your steps back to the main path, or climb more directly up the slope on the left, known as the Ladder. This is a steep boulder field but in summer an ingenious path leads through it; in winter this slope is notorious for avalanches. Above the Ladder the slope eases onto the plateau. Follow the edge of the cliffs (not too closely!) round to the right; in good weather you can peer down the gullies to the lochan below. As the cliffs curve to the northwest, there is another ascent, and the minor cairn on a boulder at Cac Càrn Mòr is just beyond.\n\nContinue further to reach the viewpoint indicator on the pointed rocky outcrop at Cac Càrn Beag, the true summit of Lochnagar, a magnificent viewpoint for Deeside and the Cairngorms massif. Lochnagar was climbed by Queen Victoria, who wrote of the summit 'But alas! Nothing whatever to be seen; and it was cold, and wet, and cheerless.' Hopefully your luck is better!\n\nReturn to Cac Càrn Mòr , and this time follow the southeast, diverting away from the cliffs. This soon descends into the upper section of the Glas Allt glen. Follow the path close to the stream as the glen opens out onto a flat 'alp'. This flatter section is short-lived, however, as just beyond the stream tumbles down a very steep slope to make the Glas Allt falls; the path winds down the hillside on its south side.\n\nFollow the path down the hillside to reach the woodland around the magnificent Royal Lodge of Glas-allt-Shiel - much beloved by Queen Victoria and more recently by Prince Charles. Turn left along the track which follows the shores of Loch Muick.\n\nAt the foot of the Loch is a boat house; turn right here to follow the path passing in front and it and then across the bottom of the loch, crossing the outflow on a footbridge. The path then leaves thAe lochside and heads northeast, soon joining a track. Turn left along this to return to the Spittal of Glenmuick.",

This crosses the glen floor to reach a footbridge over the Inverie River. Cross this and continue, soon passing Druim bothy - privately-owned, this is kept locked and is available for rental. The path soon leads across another footbridge, this time across the Allt Gleann Meadail, to enter the lower reaches of Gleann Meadail. When the crags barring the lower end of the Druim Righeanaich relent it is possible to leave the path and climb the steep, very rough slope up to gain the ridge; in high summer this slope is further defended by high bracken and some may prefer to continue up the path to the head of the glen and tackle Meall Buidhe from there. Otherwise, once on the Druim Righeanaich it leads much more easily up to the top of An t-Uiriollaich. There are superb views back down to Inverie bay, with the islands of Eigg, Rum, and the Sleat peninsula of Skye beyond.\n\nThere is a short descent and then a straightforward climb up the ridge to reach the Munro summit of Meall Buidhe. Continue to the east top; from here the descent of the northeast ridge is very steep but there is a clear path that winds between the crags and avoids any real difficulties. After the first steeper section the ridge becomes a complex mass of slabs, crags and grassy patches but a path has formed for most of the route and eases what would otherwise be very complex and difficult navigation in poor conditions. Continue to the Bealach Ile Coire, with dramatic views back to Meall Buidhe.\n\nThe ridge climbs over more lumps and bumps onto the more substantial grassy top of Druim Leac a'Shith, though the summit of this is passed on the west side. There are superb views of craggy Ben Aden and along Loch Quoich. Descend via Meall Coire na Gaoithe'n Ear to reach the lowest point between the two Munros, the Bealach a'Choire Odhair. From here a more sustained ascent climbs up towards Luinne Bheinn; before reaching the east top there are some craggier sections with simple scrambling.\n\nOnce at the east top a sensational view opens up down to Barrisdale Bay on Loch Hourn, with Beinn Sgritheall towering beyond. Continue past the summit cairn and along the ridge which descends steeply at times to Bachd Mhic an Tosaich. After this the path peters out; descend west down boggy slopes before the end of the ridge to gain a very wet section of path that follows an old fence line on this side of Luinne Bheinn, and follow this to reach the cairn that marks the high point on the Mam Barrisdale pass.\n\nTurn left on the path to begin the long walk back to Inverie. This old right of way is very gently graded at first and offers good walking with footbridges over several side streams. Before reaching Loch an Dubh-Lochain however it becomes very wet and waterlogged in places. Once at the loch the going improves; cast a last look back at Luinne Bheinn which looks impressive from here. The path passes a ruin above the loch and becomes a track, rejoining the outward route to pass below the Brocket Memorial once more before returning to Inverie.",

    "description": "Start from the walker's car park on the right after turning into Attadale Estate from the A890 south of Strathcarron. There is a map showing the route. Walk along the entrance driveway, bearing left towards the entrance to the Gardens. Pass some cottages on the right and when the Gardens entrance is reached turn right along the road up the Glen, away from Attadale House. The lane follows the pleasant strath, when it forks take the lower, right hand side signed for cottages and walkers. Eventually pass through a gate near the estate holiday cottages; after this the track becomes rougher. Continue along it, ignoring two turnings to the right, to reach a bridge over the River Attadale. Go right across this and follow the track as it begins to climb through birch woodland. It soon joins a new bulldozed hydro track heading uphill - hopefully the scars from this will heal with time.\n\nThere are great views back over Lochcarron backed by the peaks of Applecross. After the climb up the valley of the Abhainn Odhar, the track flattens out somewhat as it crosses undulating moors, with forestry plantations over to the right. Ignore two tracks off on the right, the second of which has a footpath signpost (for Killilan in Kintail). The track winds around, passing the small Loch an Droigan, before climbing steeply in zig-zags after passing the outflow of Loch na Caillich.\n\nThe gradient then eases once more and Bidein a'Choire Sheasgaich and Lurg Mhòr finally come into view at last - though still distant - and eventually the track heads gently downhill into a new, empty landscape. After descending down the empty Srath Feith a'Mhadaidh for over a kilometre, the original track climbs slightly and then drops again towards the wide Uisage Dhubh or Black Water River, curving to the south to reach an attractive cast-iron bridge where the river flows through a small ravine. Cross the bridge and continue on the track which turns left on the far side (you can avoid some of the hydro track by keeping on the old track closer to the river).\n\nA kilometre and a half further on a pair of lonely buildings is reached at Bendronaig Lodge. The first of these is a lodge used by stalkers, but just beyond is the second building. This is maintained by the Attadale Estate as an open bothy for the use of walkers. Whether staying here, camping nearby or just popping in, please repay the estate's generosity by carrying out all your rubbish and keeping the place tidy; flush the toilet by filling the cistern using the bucket in the stream outside.\n\nBeyond the bothy, a bulldozed track continues east. This soon reaches a junction and a rickety footbridge over the Allt Coire na Sorna (the hydro track avoids this). Take the branching track that climbs up the glen on the north side of the Allt Coire na Sorna. It climbs up into Coire na Sorna before crossing a low bealach and descending slightly to the lonely shores of Loch Calavie, beloved of fishermen.\n\nFollow the track for a short distance along the northern shore, to where the Allt Coire Calavie flows into the loch. Here, turn left and climb up beside the stream. The going is usually a little wet; after a long, fairly sustained climb the gradient eases; aim a little to the right to reach the bealach between Bidein a'Choire Sheasgaich and Lurg Mhor. Turn right to tackle Lurg Mhòr first.\n\nA surprisingly good path makes for an easy ascent, with two steepish sections before the cairn is reached, and good views behind of the Bidein. The summit cairn of Lurg Mhor, 986 metres, is prized as undoubtedly amongst the remotest of all Munros, and is situated close to the edge of its steep northern crags. East of the summit the ridge descends and dramatically narrows to make a scramble across exposed slippery slabs necessary for any walkers wishing to make a detour to the eastern top of Meall Mòr (not included in the distance and times for this route); instead, return to the bealach.\n\nThis time follow the path westwards as it winds up towards the Bidein. This ascent steepens towards the end, curving right to reach the narrow, graceful summit ridge of Bidein a'Choire Sheagaich. Nicknamed 'Cheesecake' by some hill-goers who are unsure of Gaelic pronunciation, this peak, although lower at 945 metres, is much finer than Lurg Mhor, it's airy summit being a just reward for the effort of reaching it. Descend southwest back along the summit ridge, and then steeply down (pathless) to a small lochan just below. From here, follow the undulating, rocky ridge out to the minor final bump of Sàil Riabhach, and continue to its termination to the west.\n\nFrom here, a route can be picked out down the primarily heathery slopes to the path in Coire na Sorna. Turn right down this path to return to Bendronaig Lodge - and the start of the long, long track back to Attadale.",

    "description": "There's a car park around 200m east of Chisholm Bridge near the head of Loch Beinn a'Mheadhoin. From here a constructed path heads into the woods, soon joining the hydro track up the east side of the Abhainn Gleann nam Fiadh; turn right up this. At first it passes near a plantation, but wilder country is soon reached with the Munros of Toll Creagach and the more impressive Tom a'Chòinich ahead. The track curves to the left through a scattered pinewood. After passing a hydro dam the route becomes a rough path and is can be very boggy in places, and crosses several streams. The Allt Toll Easa can be impassable in high spate but is usually straightforward. A path goes off right immediately afterwards - stay on the boggy path up the glen instead.\n\nThe cone-like peak of Sròn Garbh further up the glen is the first objective. Continue up the glen for a couple more kilometres until below Coire Mhic Fhearchair. When the path forks, take the higher path to the right which leaves the main stream. It is indistinct where it crosses the Allt Coire Mhic Fhearchair - if you lose the path, you are aiming for the grassy shoulder directly ahead. Further up the path is much clearer as it zig-zags up to the hanging plateau below the Garbh-bealach. Continue up the easy grassy ground all the way to the bealach between Sròn Garbh and An Leth-chreag, where a sudden view of Loch Mullardoch and its own range of Munros comes into view.\n\nTurn left at the bealach for the final steep rocky ascent to Sròn Garbh. There is a loose path to the left but if you follow the crest of the ridge you should be able to ascend an amazing man-made rock-staircase, the remains of an old stalking path. This leads up to the flatter ground at the Top of Sròn Garbh - and a grand ridgewalk now stretches ahead. The ridge is straightforward at first but after Stob Coire Dhomhnuill it is riven into a series of jagged, broken pinnacles. Keen scramblers will attempt to traverse them, but there is a bypass path initially on the right and soon switching across to the left side. Beyond there is a slight ascent to Stob a'Choire Dhomhain before a wide bealach and the final climb up to Càrn Eige.\n\nThis summit, marked by a trig point inside a wind-shelter cairn, is 1183 metres, making it the highest mountain north of the Great Glen. The views are extremely extensive, stretching from Skye in the west to the Moray Firth and Ben Rinnes in the east. At this point a decision must be made whether to include Beinn Fhionnlaidh in the day. This involves the loss of a great deal of height and an eventual reascent but Beinn Fhionnlaidh is very difficult to reach from anywhere else so most Munro-baggers will want to go for it. Descend the northwest ridge, which mostly has a good path.\n\nA stony section of the descent is avoided by keeping to the path near the ridge crest. The path then traverses to the left of Stob Coire Lochan before descending once more to the wide Bealach Beag at 832 metres. From here the path heads directly up the steep grassy slope to the north towards Beinn Fhionnlaidh, with the final section being an enjoyable easy ridge. Beinn Fhionnlaidh is one of the most prized Munro summits due to its remoteness, and has great views both along Loch Mullardoch and looking back to Càrn Eige over the large Coire Lochain.\n\nReturn to the bealach and reascend most of the way back up Càrn Eige. At around 1040 metres there is a flatter shoulder; from here it is possible to traverse across the west side of Càrn Eige to avoid the need to return all the way to the summit. There are traces of a path keeping just below the initial areas of loose stones; continue to contour the slope, rising just slightly and finally crossing a couple of areas of stones before emerging back on the ridge at the bealach between Càrn Eige and Mam Sodhail. If unsure of the ground or the navigation it may be easier to stick with the ridge over Càrn Eige instead. From the bealach a path climbs southwards, finally zig-zagging before reaching the massive cairn on the top of Mam Sodhail. The cairn is hollow but the inside can only be reached by climbing it; it was built by the Ordnance Survey and used as the principal triangulation point for northern Scotland.\n\nAs that suggests, the views are as extensive as those from Càrn Eige. In poor weather, you could escape from the ridges from here by descending the southwest ridge and then following the zig-zag path down the headwall of Coire Leachavie. The upper parts of the corrie are very boggy but further down is a stalkers path that leads to the main Loch Affric path and the long walk out. In good conditions, however, it is more enjoyable to along the long ESE ridge towards Mullach Cadha Rainich. The ridge is narrow but grassy and gives a very enjoyable traverse. There is only a very slight ascent over the Top of Mullach Catha Rainich. Beyond there is a longer but gradual ascent to the terminal peak of Sgùrr na Lapaich along the edge of a curious landslip.\n\nThis summit, not be be confused with the Mullardoch Sgùrr na Lapaich further north, was once a Munro before being demoted to the status of a Top; many walkers feel it deserves Munro status and it could become one again in the future. The views may be less far-reaching than those earlier in the day, but they are more beautiful, with wonderful aerial panoramas over Glen Affric, its forests and lochs. Descend the SE ridge, which is steep and rocky though a path avoids any need for scrambling. Once down to the level of the moors, head east to meet a track at a prominent bend. Head down the track which leads to the shores of Loch Affric below Affric Lodge. Turn left along the main track to reach the car park at the end of the road. A further mile down the tarmac road is Chisholm Bridge and the start.",

    "description": "Park at Achnashellach Forest car park, which is signed on the north side of the road at Craig. Walk back down cross the road, following the track opposite across the railway level crossing. The track bends left and heads up the glen. There are great views ahead of Sgùrr nan Ceannaichean. After about a kilometre the track bends right and crosses a bridge over the River Carron. Once across the river the track soon forks; take the left fork, which begins a long climb above the (unseen) Sloc Mòr gorge.\n\nAs height is gained, a terrific view opens up behind of the Coulin peaks. First to appear is Fuar Tholl on the left, later joined by Sgùrr Ruadh and Beinn Liath Mhor. After just over a kilometre another forestry track goes off to the right - ignore this and keep to the main track, with views ahead of the Allt a Chonais gorge. Further on another track goes off right, this time signed for the 'Allt a'Chonais pinewood'; again continue ahead.\n\nThe track passes through a gate in a deer fence before reaching the top of a pass just to the left of a knoll. Sgùrr Chòinnich and Sgùrr a'Chaorachain can now be seen ahead at the far end of the flat, treeless valley, but Maoille Lunndaidh still remains out of sight round a corner. Continue on the track, now slightly downhill, ignore a track leading to a small hydro dam. The track soon runs close to the river passing a wire bridge. Ignore a faint path on the right destined for Sgùrr na Feartaig, instead continuing until the track bends left and climbs.\n\nA cairn marks where a stalkers path turns off here on the right; ignore this and continue on the track which now swings left. Continue on the track for almost another three kilometres to where it runs along the right hand side of a plantation. Just beyond the far side of the plantation abandon the track and head east across the bogs. There is a deep, slow-moving stream but there are a couple of easy places where it can be crossed. There are views to Glenuig Lodge at the end of the track you've left.\n\nClimb slightly over the very rough, swampy and awkward terrain to reach the Am Crom-allt at the confluence with the Allt an Fhuar-thuill Bhig where there is a waterfall. Cross the Am Crom-allt and head southeast over the lumpy ground crossing a stalkers path to start a direct ascent of the slope. This is a hard climb up steep heather but begins to ease at around 800 metres. Continue uphill to reach the rim of the Fuar Tholl Mòr corrie with its lower lochan visible far below.\n\nFollow the plateau edge with great views down the cliffs all the way. A short detour to the right reaches the cairn at the summit of Càrn nam Fiaclan but return to the plateau edge to continue for half kilometre to the small cairn on Creag Toll a'Choin, now regarded as the true Munro summit. From a few paces away there's a great view down to Loch Monar.\n\nThe former high point is reached ruther 700m further on, in a northeasterly direction across easy terrain; it is marked by another, much larger cairn. To descend head northwest down the ridge which is littered with areas of stone, bearing slightly more west to bypass the actual bealach and pick up a path running down the south side of the burn from the bealach.\n\nThis stream soon meets another coming down from Lochan an Fhuar-thuill. Although the path continues ahead on high ground to the right of the waterfalls it soon reaches much more difficult ground and descending this way leaves you with more glen walking to get back to Glenuaig Lodge. Therefore bear left before the waterfall to cross the stream and climb up the far bank and head west across the boggy ground to reach the same crossing point on the Am Crom-allt. Cross here and retrace the outward route across the bogs to the track and back down the glen.",

Follow the track until a sign marks a path on the left. Take this path; it then rejoins a hydro track further on - bear left along this. Look out for a signed path on the right hand side that avoids the hydro works; it continues over open moorland, crossing a small side burn and following the glen on the east side of the Fionn-abhainn. The river is soon crossed on a wooden bridge and the path continues on the other side passing a memorial on a stone a little further on.\n\nSoon a building comes into view. This is Coire Fionnaraich, a bothy maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting. A little further on a large stone, the Clach nan Con-fionn, is passed. Looking a bit like a Henry Moore sculpture, legend has it that the stone was used by the giant, Fionn to tether his hunting dogs.\n\n400 metres further on, a small cairn marks a path junction; turn left here to begin a zig-zag climb up a stalkers path, with Maol Chean-dearg visible ahead. The path is clear all the way up to the bealach, with the looming crags of Meall nan Ceapairnean on the left.\n\nOnce at the bealach a Choire Garbh there is an impressive view of the Corbett An Ruadh-stac. Turn right up an indistinct path heading north west, initally over quartzite scree.\n\nThe path splits into a number of worn trods up the steep scree. The scree section is short and followed by a grassy plateau with only a faint path. There is then a rocky section with a few ledges running across the ridge which could confuse in poor visibility; beyond these the final ascent is up smallish sandstone boulders until the large summit cairn comes into view.\n\nJust beyond the cairn, with its numerous shelters, is a fabulous view down the steep face to Loch an Eion below and across to the Torridon peaks.\n\nThe descent is via the same outward route back to the bealach. From here the easiest route is to retrace your steps back down the stalkers path. Other alternatives include making a long circular walk all the way round Maol Chean-dearg (description here), or returning over Meall nan Ceapairnean as described in the An Ruadh Stac route.",

Nowhere else in the Highlands can so many peaks be climbed in a day, with minimal descent between the summits, and the views are excellent all the way. However, this is a long day with steep ground on either side of the ridge - route finding skills and a fast pace are required. If in any doubt about fitness, the route can be split into two days by using the Druim na Coire nan Eirecheanach ridge to descend from the ridge at the end of the first day, and use the Druim Thollaidh ridge to regain the ridge to begin the second day.",
    "description": "The whole ridge on the south side of Glen Shiel is described as a single walk. Although a long day, this is the way most walkers tackle it. Note that this walk finishes around nine kilometres down the A87 from the start point, so you will probably want to arrange transport back up the glen, leave a bike, or try to time things for the bus service. Just east of the Cluanie Inn is the start of the old road from Cluanie to Tomdoun; it is possible to park fifty metres along this road. The walk begins by continuing along this private road soon crossing a bridge. At a fork keep right; the lower route goes to Cluanie Lodge. As the route climbs there are great views back over Loch Cluanie and the old road crosses a lovely stone bridge.\n\nContinue onwards all the way until a bealach.Even though it might feels wrong to lose height, this route is much easier going than crossing the rough pathless ground on the more direct line, so continue for another kilometre after the bealach. Just before another small bridge look out for a cairn on the right marking a stalkers path. The path climbs up zig-zags to the ridge, keep straight on where a smaller path, marked with a tiny cairn, forks left. There are great views back over Loch Loyne.\n\nThe summit of Creag a' Mhaim is the first Munro of the day at 947 metres. The most strenuous climb of the walk is now already behind, as the marvellous South Glen Shiel Ridge stretches ahead.\n\nThere is only a very short descent to the first col, after which the ridge begins to narrow on the gradual climb up to the second peak. The final section of ridge before the summit of Druim Shionnach is very narrow and rocky and can be avoided by using a bypass path just off to the left; you have now reached your second Munro at 987m.\n\nThe next peak is three kilometres further along the ridge, though the undulations are fairly gentle. There are great slabby crags sweeping down into the corries to the north, but the southern slopes are much gentler. The reward is your third Munro, Aonach air Chrith which at 1021m is the highest summit on the whole ridge. From here, most of the rest of the days ridge can be seen winding ahead. Shortly after the summit there is a narrow and rocky section of ridge (which can be bypassed) and soon a narrow grassy path enables a faster pace once more.\n\nThe ridge undulates over a couple of very minor summits before ascending to the fourth Munro, Maol Chinn-Dearg (981metres). From here the path along the ridge bypasses the top of the minor peak of Sgùrr Coire na Feinne before a long slow ascent to munro number five, Sgùrr an Doire Leathain (1010 metres).\n\nThe very summit of this mountain is a short distance along the northeast ridge and requires a slight detour NE. It has a fine view of the next peak, Sgùrr an Lochain which is the most distinctive on the whole ridge. Return to the main ridge, which now has good views down to the loch in Coire Lochain, and climbs easily up to Sgùrr an Lochain (1004 m).\n\nEnjoy the view from this sixth and finest Munro of the day before heading along the seemingly endless ridge once more. The next peak Sgùrr Beag is not a Munro and most walkers have worn a path which avoids its summit, passing to the south side, before the ridge drops to its lowest point at 729 metres with a little lochan. The climb up to the final Munro (Creag nan Dàmh) is likely to be a trial for worn-out limbs. Continue along the ridge and after a pronounced dip, take care on the short, straightforward, scramble up the far side.\n\nStay on the ridge for nearly 2km from the final peak, following the remains of a drystone dyke to the Bealach Duibh Leac where a small cairn marks where to turn north to start the steeper part of the descent. From here follow an old stalkers path, initially faint but marked by some small cairns at first, which winds down the northern slope and is boggy and rocky in places. Further down it becomes clearer and crosses, then leads down the west side of the Allt Coire Mhurlagain. Later on, keep the fence on your left and as the road in the bottom of the glen comes into view, the path forks. The main left branch leads to a ford over the burn, whilst the boggy right hand one veers away from the fence to reach an old footbridge at NG 970134. From here continue down through bracken, in the summer, to a gate leading to the A87. Now all you need to do is get back to your start point several km back up the busy road - there is a layby just to the right.",

    "description": "Start from the Glen Doll car park at the head of Glen Clova where there is a ranger information post and toilets (parking charge). From the start there is a great view of the Scorrie - the steep shoulder of Driesh that rises dramatically from the floor of the glen.\n\nFrom the car park follow the sign for Forest Walks and take the track past the farm at Acharn, keeping left at the fork here (sign Forest Walks). At the next junction ignore the track off left, following the signs for Corrie Fee. Soon Jock's Road, the ancient route to Braemar leaves to the right, stay on the main track running alongside, and soon crossing, the White Water. Keep on the track, taking the left branch when it forks. Soon the path narrows and heads into the woods.\n\nThe path winds uphill, crossing a small stream, and then reaches the deer fence at the entrance to Corrie Fee National Nature Reserve. From the viewpoint just beyond the magnificent bowl shape of the corrie is suddenly revealed, with a fine waterfall at the back.\n\nFollow the path across the undulating bottom of the corrie, the bumps are mounds of glacial debris left by the retreating glacier that carved out the corrie. The area has a large number of rare plants and it is also a good place to spot golden eagles and other birds of prey. At the back of the corrie the well-made path starts to climb steeply, keeping well to the left of the waterfall.\n\nOnce the path emerges onto the plateau it heads SSW to climb gently toward Mayar, eventually becoming an informal hill path. The Munro summit is marked with a small cairn, and a fairly extensive view across the rolling tableands of the Mounth plateau. From the summit head north northeast for a very short distance to avoid steep ground, and then follow the path (with very occasional fenceposts) eastwards.\n\nAt a tall post, the Kilbo path and a line of posts from the south come up to join the route. The path to the right leads down the Shank of Drumwhallo into Glen Prosen; continue straight ahead along the plateau, now with more regular fenceposts. This passes the south side of the top of the Shank of Drumfollow which extends northwards from the plateau. Our eventual descent route is the path that descends NNE along the right flank of the Shank, but first we have Driesh to climb. Descend slightly to reach the bealach between Corrie Kilbo and Black Skellies.\n\nBeyond the bealach a rough path climbs the initially steeper slope ahead and then continues towards the dome shaped summit area, passing a couple of small cairns before the trig point and massive shelter cairn at the summit of Driesh is reached. The views are extensive - especially towards the Firth of Tay - but the flat plateau does rob them of much depth. The route marked on some maps descending the NNE ridge via the Scorrie is very steep and poorly defined - this is really much better left as an challenging alternative ascent route. Instead, to make a safer descent retrace the outward route down to the col and part way up the other side pick up a path to the right, linking to the path down the side of the Shank of Drumfollow.\n\nThe path descends across the slope to eventually reach the forestry. It passes through a gate in a deer fence and continues descending through the forest, crossing the Burn of Kilbo on stepping stones. After a while keep straight across at a track to continue downhill. When the track is reached again turn left to follow it round a bend to the right, continuing downhill. At the next junction turn left to cross a bridge and then right to follow the original track back to the car park.",

    "description": "These two hills look fine from the Kinghouse Hotel, where the northern end of the Creise ridge descends dramatically in the crags of Sròn na Creise. This offers a classic route of ascent but requires both a river crossing and a difficult, exposed scramble. The route described here is more straightforward. Turn south from the A82 as it crosses Rannoch Moor onto the minor road to the Glencoe Mountain Ski Centre and follow it to the ski car park at White Corries. Begin the walk by heading to the right of the main building and the foot of the chair lift, then aim between the two higher ski centre buildings before turning right onto a signed path beneath the chairlift.\n\nThe path climbs uphill, soon meeting a mountain bike track. Go straight across this, continuing uphill and becoming steep and very eroded, crossing a minor burn at one point. The route is under the shadow of the chairlift that climbs this same slope - and which may tempt the lazier walkers to use the uplift on this initial climb.\n\nWhen the slope finally eases take a signed path which passes well to the right of the upper chairlift station. This soon joins a wide path running from the chairlift (to your left) and the top of point 748m to your right - turn towards the latter. After crossing a metal bridge over a burn the easiest option is to turn left off the main path onto a narrow path with red marker posts (watch out for mountain bikers). This threads a winding route west through the bogs to gain a wide bealach at 724m. From here there's a sudden view to Buachaille Etive Mòr looking typically impressive.\n\nNow head up the broad ridge towards Meall a' Bhùiridh. It is grassy and featureless at this lower end, but becomes progressively steeper as you gain height; the uppermost sections are over stones and boulders. There are good views of the Creise ridge rising above the Glas Choire.\n\nEventually the slope eases and the rocky summit of Meall a'Bhùiridh is reached. Before you lies the great gulf of Coire an Easain. The views are superb; far below is the little Loch an Easain, and directly opposite are the cliffs of the Clach Leathad ridge. The vast expanse of Rannoch Moor stretches to the east, with Schiehallion clearly seen in the distance. Southeast the line of the West Highland railway is visible below the steep slopes of Beinn Achaladair.\n\nNow head west southwest down a rocky ridge to a bealach, then rises again, becoming steep and rocky, to gain the broad spine of the Creise - Clach Leathad ridge.\n\nTurn north and continue along this almost level ridge to reach the summit of Creise. Looking west the view over the Glen Etive peaks is impressive, whilst looking back south Clach Leathad appears to be almost of equal height - originally this was regarded as the Munro summit until more accurate surveys revealed Creise was the highest point.\n\nThe scree-covered slopes of Meall a'Bhùiridh to the east add drama to the view here, with Rannoch Moor still visible behind. Return by the outward route - a cairn usually marks the point where the linking ridge descends eastwards; it is necessary to climb back over Meall a' Bhùiridh.",

Note that this road is not kept open in the winter months. An initially very well-made path leaves the road a short distance east of the cairn, heading northeast onto the moors - and giving good views back over the reservoir. The path peters out in the bealach dividing Meall nan Eun from the rest of the range.\n\nNavigation for the ascent of Meall Corranaich is aided by a line of old fence posts. These lead southeast over a small hillock (which can be avoided) before bearing SSE and then southeast once more up the very broad ridge. Rather than ascending right to the top of the ridge the fence posts finally cut away left across the slopes to take a more direct line towards Meall Corranaich. Finally the going improves as the steeper southwest ridge of Meall Corranaich is gained, leading up over a small knobble; there are stunning views looking back.\n\nContinue a short distance further to reach the summit cairn. The view east is dominated by the huge bulk of Ben Lawers and the neighbouring peaks of An Stùc and Meall Garbh, but in other directions it is extensive; Ben More and Stob Binnein being prominent to the southwest.\n\nLeave the summit by following the ridge to the north, soon passing over a second minor summit. The ridge leading on from here to the bealach and Meall a'Choire Lèith is easily missed - even in clear weather - as the natural line is to continue north and end up on the NNW ridge. The correct route is to head NNE from the northern summit, losing height to gain the lower, true north ridge.\n\nOnce this is gained follow it - with a path once more - as it curves round to the bealach, with the steep crags of Coire Lèith on the right. From the bealach continue north - with great views back - to reach the flat summit of Meall a'Choire Lèith, the least distinguished of the Lawers Munros.\n\nThe cairn of flattish stones marking the summit has a view which may be robbed of depth by the plateau, but is still very fine on a good day - with the peaks of Glencoe seen in the far distance over Loch an Dàimh.\n\nThe route back gives rougher going. Descend southwest down steep grass, soon picking up a path. Cross the burn flowing down Coire Gorm and traverse the slopes of the far side, gradually losing height to reach the Allt Gleann Da-Eig above a concrete intake. After crossing this larger burn continue southwest across the bogs to regain the path that descends back to the big cairn and the start.",

Meall a' Chrasgaigh and Sgùrr nan Clach Geala are both in clear view from here. Once across this bridge, follow the stalkers path for about 30m before turning off on a smaller, boggy ATV track.\n\nThis leads to a bridge over the Allt Breabaig which isn't marked on the OS maps, and avoids the possibility of having a difficult crossing of the Allt Breabaig. Once across the bridge continue along the very boggy ATV track, which heads S and then SE; you may spot the old stalkers path coming up from the ford. After just over a kilometre from the bridge choose a good place to leave the ATV trod and strike off directly up the steep slopes towards Meall a' Chrasgaidh. There is no path and the ascent is arduous, but there are soon fine views back towards An Teallach and the western Fannichs peaks.\n\nHigher up the slope eases considerably for the final kilometre to the summit of Meall a'Chrasgaidh. The cairn here is at 934m, but the peak is rather overshadowed by the much higher peaks of Sgùrr Mòr to the southeast and Sgùrr nan Clach Geala to the south; it is one of the less distinguished of the Fannichs' Munros.\n\nHead south from the summit to the bealach and then make a rising traverse to the lochan on the bealach between Càrn na Criche and Sgùrr nan Clach Geala. This is known as 'Am Biachdaich - meaning the place of the fattening, due to its fine grasses; the waters of the lochan often reflect the elegant domed peak of Sgùrr Mòr.\n\nFrom the col, climb the slope beyond. This is fairly broad at first but soon narrows to a fine ridge, one of the most enjoyable section of the day. There are huge sweeping crags to the left as the fine ridge curves round over several undulations before finally reaching the trig point on the summit of Sgùrr nan Clach Geala.\n\nThis has a magnificent situation with a great feeling of space all around. The walk continues down the broader south ridge (still with steep crags on the left), which leads downhill for a long way to reach the pass at Cadha na Guite.\n\nTo reach the third Munro of the day, continue up the ridge beyond. It curves gracefully first to the right and then to the left, giving a fine traverse to the summit of Sgùrr nan Each. The highest cairn is at the far end of the little ridge at 922 metres.\n\nReturn to Cadha na Guite, and then descend the steep western slopes. There is no path at first, but eventually a rough one can be picked up that descends diagonally across the slopes to the right - crossing a patch of scree and becoming very boggy lower down. Aim to reach the col at the head of the Allt Breabaig valley, which requires careful navigation in mist, avoiding a descent too far into Fliuch Choire.\n\nThe col here is very boggy as is the first part of the descent to the north; try to pick up the top of the stalkers path - just the far side of the valley floor - as soon as you can, as it gives a better chance of dry feet. Continue down this improving path, which soon crosses back to the east bank of the stream. After crossing several smaller burns (the Allt Daimh Mor could be a problem in high spate) it comes close to outward route. You can either continue down the stalkers path all the way to the ford of the Allt Breabaig and then continue down past some beautiful pools, or if the burn is high head for bridge used by the ATV track earlier in the day. Either way, return to the bridge at the outflow of Loch a'Bhraoin and reverse the outward route to return to the start.",

Keep climbing the easy slope.\n\nWhen the south summit (917m) is reached there are great views along the easy broad ridge with the summit cairn visible. Continue in a north-west direction along the ridge.\n\nThe summit of Meall Bhuidhe (932m) is marked by a cairn. There are good views over Loch Rannoch, to Glencoe in the west and to Ben Nevis in the north.\n\nThe return is by the same outward route. The views across the reservoir show the fine corrie of Stuchd an Lochain nicely and the dam can look impressive seen from overhead. In good conditions, this mountain must be one of the fastest and easiest Munros to complete, leaving time for most baggers to climb Stuchd an Lochain on the same day.",

    "description": "From the landing pier in Inverie, turn right along the road passing the Old Forge pub, the tea room and shop as well as a memorial to the Seven Men of Knoydart - land-raiders who staked out claims for crofts on Knoydart after World War 2; they lost their case but won massive public sympathy. Continue through the woodland until the road bends right and a track continues ahead - take the track, which is signed as a right of way to Kinlochhourn and Strathan. It climbs through the trees to reach another junction; fork right here through the gate, continuing on a track along the top of the forestry and then slightly downhill, through an open stretch and then another brief block of forest; ignore a track off right. Further on there is a prominent memorial up to the left - this was placed here by Lord Brocket to commemorate his father. A Nazi-sympathiser, Brocket was Laird here at the time of the land raids.\n\nThe track passes well below the memorial; further on, look out for a branch track off to the right. This crosses the glen floor to reach a footbridge over the Inverie River. Cross this and continue, soon passing Druim bothy - privately-owned, this is kept locked and is available for rental. The path soon leads across another footbridge, this time across the Allt Gleann Meadail, to enter the lower reaches of Gleann Meadail. When the crags barring the lower end of the Druim Righeanaich relent it is possible to leave the path and climb the steep, very rough slope up to gain the ridge; in high summer this slope is further defended by high bracken and some may prefer to continue up the path to the head of the glen and tackle Meall Buidhe from there. Otherwise, once on the Druim Righeanaich it leads much more easily up to the top of An t-Uiriollaich. There are superb views back down to Inverie bay, with the islands of Eigg, Rum, and the Sleat peninsula of Skye beyond.\n\nThere is a short descent and then a straightforward climb up the ridge to reach the Munro summit of Meall Buidhe. Continue to the east top; from here the descent of the northeast ridge is very steep but there is a clear path that winds between the crags and avoids any real difficulties. After the first steeper section the ridge becomes a complex mass of slabs, crags and grassy patches but a path has formed for most of the route and eases what would otherwise be very complex and difficult navigation in poor conditions. Continue to the Bealach Ile Coire, with dramatic views back to Meall Buidhe.\n\nThe ridge climbs over more lumps and bumps onto the more substantial grassy top of Druim Leac a'Shith, though the summit of this is passed on the west side. There are superb views of craggy Ben Aden and along Loch Quoich. Descend via Meall Coire na Gaoithe'n Ear to reach the lowest point between the two Munros, the Bealach a'Choire Odhair. From here a more sustained ascent climbs up towards Luinne Bheinn; before reaching the east top there are some craggier sections with simple scrambling.\n\nOnce at the east top a sensational view opens up down to Barrisdale Bay on Loch Hourn, with Beinn Sgritheall towering beyond. Continue past the summit cairn and along the ridge which descends steeply at times to Bachd Mhic an Tosaich. After this the path peters out; descend west down boggy slopes before the end of the ridge to gain a very wet section of path that follows an old fence line on this side of Luinne Bheinn, and follow this to reach the cairn that marks the high point on the Mam Barrisdale pass.\n\nTurn left on the path to begin the long walk back to Inverie. This old right of way is very gently graded at first and offers good walking with footbridges over several side streams. Before reaching Loch an Dubh-Lochain however it becomes very wet and waterlogged in places. Once at the loch the going improves; cast a last look back at Luinne Bheinn which looks impressive from here. The path passes a ruin above the loch and becomes a track, rejoining the outward route to pass below the Brocket Memorial once more before returning to Inverie.",

Head north along the verge to reach a gate marking the start of a clear track - this is often locked but there is a pedestrian gate alongside. Follow the track as it heads southeast and soon reaches a wider track alongside a concrete aqueduct. Turn left along this track, which continues alongside the aqueduct.\n\nAfter a couple of kilometres the track crosses the aqueduct and the Cuaich hydro-electric power station is reached. This small station generates 2.5 MW of power; the aqueduct then carries the water to Loch Ericht to the southwest. Cross the bridge and continue on the track up the glen. A pipeline comes down from the hillsides to the right; ignore the track that heads off beside this and pass it on the left. Ignore further tracks off right and one off left and continue ahead, crossing another bridge further on over the Allt a'Choire Chais. Shortly before Loch Cuaich is reached, turn right on the track leading up the glen of the Allt Coire Chuaich. This track soon passes a private wooden bothy, which is kept locked, and then crosses another bridge.\n\nOnce over this, where the track bends right, a path - usually marked by a small cairn - goes off left through the heather. Take this path which ascends the wide shoulder of Stac Meall Chuaich; ignore a track which contours over to the right. Higher up the path becomes drier, but also wider and stonier, with great views back towards Ben Alder.\n\nAn ATV track heads over the summit of Stac Meall Chuaich, or you can cut the corner by forking right before it is reached. After crossing shoulder, head up a short stretch of stonier ground before continuing on a beeline for the top of Meall Chuaich.\n\nThis 951m Munro summit is marked by a large cairn; it makes up for the comparative lack of interest during the ascent by being an excellent viewpoint. South and east are the vast featureless plateaux of the Drumochtor and Gaick tops, whilst northeast the Cairngorms summits can be picked out. The pick of the view, however, is north over Badenoch and Strathspey - Meall Chuaich's cornerstone-like position giving a fine outlook.\n\nThe easiest and usual return route is retrace the outward route. If looking for a variation, you could follow the fence posts south down the moorland before eventually joining the track above the Allt Coire Chuaich.",

    "description": "There is a small parking layby just north of the summit of the Lairig an Lochain road that links Loch Tay with Glen Lyon, marked by a large cairn. Note that this road is not kept open in the winter months. An initially very well-made path leaves the road a short distance east of the cairn, heading northeast onto the moors - and giving good views back over the reservoir. The path peters out in the bealach dividing Meall nan Eun from the rest of the range.\n\nNavigation for the ascent of Meall Corranaich is aided by a line of old fence posts. These lead southeast over a small hillock (which can be avoided) before bearing SSE and then southeast once more up the very broad ridge. Rather than ascending right to the top of the ridge the fence posts finally cut away left across the slopes to take a more direct line towards Meall Corranaich. Finally the going improves as the steeper southwest ridge of Meall Corranaich is gained, leading up over a small knobble; there are stunning views looking back.\n\nContinue a short distance further to reach the summit cairn. The view east is dominated by the huge bulk of Ben Lawers and the neighbouring peaks of An Stùc and Meall Garbh, but in other directions it is extensive; Ben More and Stob Binnein being prominent to the southwest.\n\nLeave the summit by following the ridge to the north, soon passing over a second minor summit. The ridge leading on from here to the bealach and Meall a'Choire Lèith is easily missed - even in clear weather - as the natural line is to continue north and end up on the NNW ridge. The correct route is to head NNE from the northern summit, losing height to gain the lower, true north ridge.\n\nOnce this is gained follow it - with a path once more - as it curves round to the bealach, with the steep crags of Coire Lèith on the right. From the bealach continue north - with great views back - to reach the flat summit of Meall a'Choire Lèith, the least distinguished of the Lawers Munros.\n\nThe cairn of flattish stones marking the summit has a view which may be robbed of depth by the plateau, but is still very fine on a good day - with the peaks of Glencoe seen in the far distance over Loch an Dàimh.\n\nThe route back gives rougher going. Descend southwest down steep grass, soon picking up a path. Cross the burn flowing down Coire Gorm and traverse the slopes of the far side, gradually losing height to reach the Allt Gleann Da-Eig above a concrete intake. After crossing this larger burn continue southwest across the bogs to regain the path that descends back to the big cairn and the start.",

The route is a grade 2/3 scramble, and is included in some climbing guides as a 'Moderate' rock climb; it involves probably the trickiest scrambling on any Walkhighlands route.

    "description": "Park at the small parking area on the north side of the A82 about three hundred metres west of the solitary house at Allt-na-reigh. This car park is often full, in which case there is a larger car park a short distance further west along the road. The view of the Aonach Eagach is rather foreshortened from here; in the photograph opposite it is shown from Loch Achtriochtan further down the glen. The path is initially a little eroded but soon joins a section which has been repaired. There are two options for the route up Am Bodach, heading either directly and very steeply up the spur to the summit, or alternatively heading further right to come alongside the Allt Ruigh.\n\nTe more direct path involves several sections of scrambling, en route to the first Top, Am Bodach. This is an excellent viewpoint, with the first hint of the drama to come in the view of a rock pinnacle known as 'The Chancellor' below (luckily our route does not visit this pinnacle!).\n\nThe first real scrambling comes on the descent from Am Bodach. A short distance from the summit there is an awkward, sloping, slabby cliff to descend; it is steep but not excessively so, but there is a large drop from the ridge below it, and it can become very slippery in the wet. Once safely down this descent, the ridge is narrow with a few short scrambly sections but fairly straightforward with a good path as it continues onto Meall Dearg. This is the first Munro of the day, at 953 metres, and is famous as being the final Munro climbed by the Reverend A.E. Robertson, who became the first man to complete the Munros here in 1901. He kissed first the cairn, and then his wife. Meall Dearg is a good viewpoint for the other Glencoe peaks, but all walkers eyes will be drawn to the ridge ahead - a frightening prospect for many!\n\nThe ridge has several steep rocky chimneys and other scrambling sections which must be climbed and descended, and is very exposed in several places (though it is not as consistently narrow as reputation would have it). There are many short scrambles necessary all along this ridge; the trickiest section is known as the 'Crazy Pinnacles' and is well along the ridge. There is a particularly tricky move right at the end - a very steep descent onto a narrow section of ridge, which must be climbed down facing the rock. The difficulties then end when the Munro 'Top' of Stob Coire Lèith is reached. Note that there are no safe descents from the Aonach Eagach once embarked on this section of ridge; there have been many accidents to scramblers attempting to leave the ridge before the end of the scrambling. The only possible escape route (if time is short) is descend northwards from Meall Dearg (incidentally this route gives an easy ascent to Meall Dearg for baggers who do not wish to traverse the ridge).\n\nFrom Stob Coire Lèith the ridge continues easily with a broad path to the second Munro, Sgòrr nam Fiannaidh, the highest on the ridge at 967 metres; it has a superb view of the lower reaches of Glen Coe. All that remains is the descent from the ridge. Do not attempt the descent along the rim of Clachaig Gully, which has an extremely eroded and very dangerous 'path', the scene of several fatalities (as well as the danger of sending stones down which could endanger the lives of others). It is sometimes recommended to descend instead southwards from the summit to Loch Achtriochtan; however this is a very steep descent with much scree and is also probably best avoided.\n\nInstead head west along the ridge. A large cairn is passed at a slight dip - ignore the path off to the left here which leads towards the Clachaig Gully and instead continue along the ridge for a short distance. Before the ridge climbs slightly to two small cairns, bear slightly right to pick up an initially indistinct path, with a stunning view ahead over the Ballachulish narrows. This stony path eventually becomes clearer and works its way down the broad slope that links the ridge with the Pap of Glencoe. The path leaves the ridge before the bealach, bearing left to join the Pap of Glencoe path further down the flank.\n\nFinally turn left down this path, soon swinging sharply back right and, after a further descent, crossing the Allt a'Mhuillin burn. On the far side follow the path to a track and then turn left to head down to the Glencoe - Clachaig road about a kilometre east of Glencoe village. If you haven't arranged transport, you have a long walk back up the glen to return to your parked car - not included in the times or distances given.",

The walk can easily be extended to take in the higher summit.",
    "description": "There is no parking at the start of the walk; the only option is to park either at the Lawers Hotel or the farmer's yard which sometimes offers parking in the busy season, both of which offer parking for a charge. Begin the walk by heading east (carefully!) along the main road. After half a kilometre along there is a white-painted cottage on the left selling antler and bone-carved products. Turn left up the track immediately beyond this. When the track swings right at a barn go straight ahead on a signed path through the trees. This soon leads up to a track, which once again swings right - again take the path straight ahead.\n\nThe path climbing up through the birchwoods is a delight, crossing a couple of small bridges and later a stile. After a second stile the trees are left behind and the Ben Lawers National Nature reserve is entered by a sign. Beyond it the path passes through an area dotted with old shielings, where folk once would have lived during the summer months. Further on the path descends into the deep gully of the Lawers burn; leave it before this at a small cairn and keep high above the burn on its east side.\n\nThe path fades out but becomes clearer once more as the ground steepens for the grassy climb up Sròn Mhòr - the southern shoulder of Meall Greigh. Once above Sròn Mhòr there is a short peaty section before the ascent continues up the south ridge. The recompense for the effort is in the fine views of Loch Tay behind.\n\nMeall Greigh is rather a sprawling and shapeless Munro but its slightly detached position at the eastern end of the Lawers Range makes it an extensive viewpoint. Most eyes will be drawn west along the broad ridge to be followed to Meall Garbh, backed by steep An Stùc and massive Ben Lawers behind, with the tiny Lochan nan Cat cradled in front of them.\n\nDescend along the ridge - which is more of a moorland at this point - with a fenceline soon joining in from the right. Continue down to the bealach of Lairig Innein, where there is some wetter going in places. Beyond the bealach continue up the grassy slopes ahead.\n\nHigher up the ridge becomes better defined and curves round to the left to reach a rocky minor peak; continue beyond this to reach the cairn at the summit of Meall Garbh itself. This second Munro of the day is a mighty 1118 metres, its summit on second of the two parallel little ridges along the top. Ben Lawers now looms much closer but all eyes will be drawn to the next peak on the ridge - An Stùc - which rises intimidatingly steeply from the next bealach.\n\nContinue down the ridge to its foot. The ascent to this peak is a steep scramble and somewhat loose - great care is required, particularly in the wet. In winter this ascent can be very difficult indeed. The cairn at the summit will probably be reached with some relief. At 1118 metres An Stùc is exactly the same height as Meall Garbh; for many years this led to controversy as only the latter peak had Munro status. All was resolved in 1997 when An Stùc was itself promoted to be a Munro as well. Its status is well deserved as this is the finest peak in the Lawers range.\n\nContinue down the easier south ridge to reach Bealach Dubh. From here a decision must be made. It is possible to continue and include Ben Lawers to make a fine circuit of Lochan nan Cat, descending along its east ridge and then northeast to regain the path up to the corrie. Others (probably having climbed Lawers before) will have had enough, and will instead turn left at the bealach, following a rather winding path down an initial steep section of the descent.\n\nThere is a short grassy interlude before a final very steep descent down to the lochan - great care is needed. From here continue east along the exit stream, following it to a dam used by the Lawers hydro scheme. A track leaves here - follow it for a brief distance before onto a clear path that keeps high above the Lawers ravine. Further on the path descends into the ravine and crosses it before rejoining the outward route and leading back to the start.",

The car park in Invervar is now closed, and the clearway order means that the nearest parking is just over 1km west of the village at a layby on the south side of the road, just beyond the clearway signs. Begin by heading along the road back to Invervar, then turning through through a gate in the village signed for the Lint Mill and to the Hill. Follow the marker posts to pass to the right of the circular mill building, soon joining a track. Turn left along the track through the woods. This soon leads through a gate and continues through a felled area.\n\nAt the top of the felled area pass through another gate to reach a large new hydro track. Do not follow this, instead turning left to follow the old track to the right of the deer fence. Further on this leads back onto a hydro track and crosses a bridge. Keep along the track until you see a rickety metal bridge over the burn down to the left - don't head for the gate, instead rounding the end of the fence and then crossing the bridge. Continue on the path up the far side of the burn around the edge of the forestry.\n\nThe path now swings left to begin the ascent proper, passing a small shieling and keeping to the right of the edge of the forest at first and then heading up the long but easy flank of Càrn Gorm, with good views back down Glen Lyon. The route steepens before reaching a small cairn on Creag Ghlas; from here the gradient relents before the final pull up towards the summit. There are two cairns - the first has a stunning view up Glen Lyon flanked by all its ranges, whilst the second - the true summit - has a broken trig point and a view over Loch Rannoch.\n\nDescend northwards, eventually curving ENE to reach a bealach at 851m at the foot of An Sgorr - a peak which looks rocky and impressive from down the Invervar glen. As it lacks Munro status most walkers bypass this peak by a path on its NW flank to reach a lower bealach beyond.\n\nContinue northeast up the open slope towards Meall Garbh; part way up a line of fenceposts coming up from the NW are joined. There are superb views in that direction, looking across Rannoch Moor and the upper part of Loch Rannoch to the Glen Coe and Ben Nevis ranges.\n\nThe fence posts which lead in a ENE direction to reach the summit of Meall Garbh. The summit is marked by a cairn 'decorated' with many fence posts. Schiehallion looks impressive, towering to the northeast. Continue east following a fainter line of fence posts (this cuts of the corner which is made if you follow the more distinct line of fence posts which is useful to do in very poor weather conditions when the path and other features cannot be made out) to a wide col; beyond this follow the fence posts to the flat and extensive summit of Meal a' Bharr (1004m).\n\nThe route continues east across almost flat ground; the rocky flank of Càrn Mairg can be seen on the right. Continue east, now ascending, until the ridge narrows, becoming rockier as it leads southeast to reach the summit of Càrn Mairg - the highest of the range at 1041m. It is worth exploring the small tor beyond which has good views down Glen Lyon and across to the Ben Lawers range. When leaving the summit care is needed to avoid the crags and steep section by heading east at first until gentler terrain is reached.\n\nFollow a faint path southeast and then south down to the next bealach. From here the path cllimbs steadily south to the summit ridge of Meall na Aighean (also often known as Creag Mhor). The actual summit is a small tor about 0.5 km east along the summit plateau. The summit cairn offers contrasting views, with the great arc of mountains round the north, west and southern horizons relenting to more rolling countryside to the east.\n\nOn leaving the summit retrace your steps briefly; you can either head over the west top or bypass it on the north side to begin the descent down the long ridge on the south side of the Allt Coire a'Chearcaill. There is a clear path down this ridge which has great views of Glen Lyon ahead, and it is not so steep that your feet are battered all the way down, making for a fine descent. Just before the ground steepens, cross a stalkers' path and continue straight ahead down the crest of the ridge. Eventually this path leads down to the hydro track almost opposite the gate used on the ascent. Go through this gate and retrace your steps back to the start.",

At the top of the field the track leads through a gate in a drystone wall - this is locked but there is a ladder stile just to the right. Pass over this and follow the now clearer track; looking back, there are already great views back over Glen Lochay. The track continues uphill with the pretty little wooded ravine of the Allt Dhuin Croisg on the right.\n\nLook out for small cairn by the track - with a pole over to the left nearby - and leave it here, , crossing a muddy channel and following an initially faint path passing to the right of the pole. Looking over to the right, old shielings are visible - reminders of the days when shepherds would stay up on the hill. Further on, the path becomes increasingly muddy, though clearer to follow, crossing over the line of a broken-down fence.\n\nAs the route climbs up onto the southeast shoulder the ground becomes much peatier, and parts of the path are a quagmire. Higher up drier ground is reached once more, and the much rockier upper section of the hill draws closer.

The going can be muddy in places but the stream has many small waterfalls, attractively fringed by trees, and provides interest during the ascent. On the left the large fenced area has been planted with native trees and should eventually become a fine woodland, whilst there are good views back over Glen Dochart to mighty Ben More. Further on the path goes through a deer fence, and finally at the top corner of a plantation it begins to peter out.\n\nContinue above the Allt Robain, soon reaching a sleeper bridge over a tributary. Around 300m further upstream is a dam. Cross the Allt Robain - the easiest place is a little below the dam - and head up the far side to reach a track which services the dam. From here head directly for Sgiath Chuil to the northeast, crossing wet moorland at first and a steeper section on drier grass higher up. Once above the steepening ground, a prominent crag is seen ahead - the summit is atop this.\n\nThe crag itself can be passed equally easily to either side to reach the cairn, which provides some stunning views. Mighty Ben Lawers is prominent, as are Ben Vorlich and Stuc a'Chroin further right. From here a broad ridge leads northwards; follow this towards a slight bealach.\n\nReaching Meall Glas from here involves an extremely very steep descent to the west down to the Lairig a'Churain. Head north along the ridge at first, then use a path that aims across the west side of Meall a' Churain. Then descend the very steep slopes to the west. The going is mostly grassy - could be very slippery when wet - with some patches of stones. After the initial steepest section continue down to the boggy bealach, over 300m lower than Sgiath Chuil.\n\nOn the far side continue up initially boggy, more gradual slopes before an equally steep climb towards Beinn Cheathaich; you can either aim for the low point the ridge south of Beinn Cheathaich, passing through a band of broken crags at one point, or bypass the crags by aiming north of the summit. From the bealach south of Beinn Cheathaich a path leads towards the Munro summit of Meall Glas a little over a kilometre away.\n\nThe summit is marked by a small cairn. Ben Challum looks very impressive from here, dominating the view west. Begin the return walk to Auchessan by heading a little southeast to pass some broken crags.\n\nThe route then heads southwards, picking up a boggy path for a lengthy moorland traverse, eventually picking up a burn and following it as it descends east of Creag nan Uan. Go straight across a faint, very wet track and keep to the path on the left side of the burn for a time. Eventually the edge of the fenced woodland regeneration area is reached; follow this downhill to the right until reaching a stile in a dip. Cross the stile and continue on the now drier, grassy path which continues down through pleasant scattered woodland near the stream. Pass to the right of the sheepfolds to join a track, and follow this down to the back of the farmhouse at Auchessan. The track passes round the left side of this to regain the outward route; now turn right to head back to the start.",

    "summary": "The main eastern range of the Fannichs is a magnificent ridge-walk taking in four Munros, including the highest, shapely Sgùrr Mòr. The price to be paid however is the rugged and boggy approach across the moors - and, more especially, the long return walk from An Coileachan.",
    "description": "Park in the small parking area just north of Torrandhu bridge on the A835. There is a Met Office weather station here. Rather than head up beside the boggy burn, a signpost instead points to a start which leads briefly east along the road. Cross the bridge and then take a right turn onto a track into the forestry. After 2.5km turn right downhill, emerging from the trees and crossing a bridge over Abhainn an Torrain Dubh. On the far side the track continues as a rough ATV track, which is boggy and intermittent in places. It does, however, assist with the ascent up towards Creag Dubh Fannaich.\n\nWhen the ATV track swings left at around 560m leave it and continue on a faint path. This peters out; continue to reach the minor summit of Creag Dhubh Fannaich, marked by a small cairn; the view extends back over Loch Glascarnoch, whilst the final two Munros on today's route look impressive above lochan-filled corries. Continue across a broad bealach and begin the ascent of Beinn Liath Mhòr Fannaich itself up a mixture of grass and boulders. The cairn on the summit, the first Munro of the day at 953 metres, is towards the western end of the small plateau, by some rocky outcrops. A good view opens out westwards over Loch a'Mhadaidh, with the prominent dome-like summit of Sgùrr Mòr towering to its left.\n\nThe intervening bealach can very difficult to locate in misty conditions, with intervening steep, stony and very loose terrain. It's probably best to descend just slightly north of west from the summit for a short distance, soon over steep stony and loose ground, to meet a stalkers path that cuts across the west side of the mountain. Turn left along this, which cuts through the steep ground and zig-zags down to the bealach. The stalkers path continues up the far side of the bealach and passes to the left of a minor peak before the ridge narrows briefly. As the ridge broadens again, the stalkers path contours round to the left; leave the path here and climb more directly up the steep slopes towards Sgùrr Mòr - again with big drops on the right.\n\nThe slope eases shortly before the impressively built summit cairn on the summit of Sgùrr Mòr is reached. At 1110 metres, this second Munro is the highest summit for miles around, and its impressive 'witches hat' outline marking it out in distant views from other mountains across the region. The view, as might be expected, is very extensive, with Sgùrr nan Clach Geala looking very impressive close at hand, and An Teallach commanding to the northwest.\n\nDescend back down the south ridge, briefly retracing steps before continuing down a slope eroded into a series of terraces made by a process known as solufluction during the last ice-age. From the bealach continue up over the minor summit of Meall nan Peithirean with its flat rocks. There are excellent views to the north all along this ridge down into a series of rocky, lochan-filled corries. The path descends gently down the far side of this top to reach a bealach, and after passing to the right of the bump of Creachan Rairigidh reaches a second bealach. Here the path forks, with a branch to the south descending towards Loch Fannich; our route follows the path which climbs up to the summit of Meall Gorm. This flat-topped Munro is the third of the walk, and has a height of 949 metres.\n\nThe ridge continues east, passing a curious and partly collapsed stone shelter presumably built by stalkers. Continue to a final top at 922m before descending steeper stony ground to reach the wide Bealach Ban. From the bealach, continue up the very wide grass and scree-covered slopes to the summit plateau - it is possible to avoid the scree by taking a traverse to the right part way up the slope - once beyond the scree ascent grassy slopes direct to the summit.\n\nThe summit of the fourth Munro, An Coileachan, is marked by a well-built cairn atop a sandstone outcrop. There's a great view looking along to the termination of the ridge at An Eigin, backed by Loch Luichart, as well as looking back over the whole range and Loch Fannich.\n\nHead north across the plateau before picking your way steeply down a stonier section - any difficulties can be avoided to the left side - heading in the direction of Loch Gorm. Once on flatter ground follow a more defined path to the bealach southwest of Meallan Buidhe. The route on from here becomes very boggy and very rough, though with a path of sorts at first. Contour the west side of Meallan Buidhe and aim a little east of north across the moors - the path fades out - to reach the Abhainn a'Ghuibhais Li at a bridge. Cross and then follow the far bank of the burn downstream to the second bridge used on the ascent. Cross this to retrace your steps via the forest track - with some unwelcome ascent - back to the car park.",

The recently-promoted Munro of An Stùc involves a steep scramble and this route is much more challenging than the usual trade route to Ben Lawers itself. The walk can easily be extended to take in the higher summit.",
    "description": "There is no parking at the start of the walk; the only option is to park either at the Lawers Hotel or the farmer's yard which sometimes offers parking in the busy season, both of which offer parking for a charge. Begin the walk by heading east (carefully!) along the main road. After half a kilometre along there is a white-painted cottage on the left selling antler and bone-carved products. Turn left up the track immediately beyond this. When the track swings right at a barn go straight ahead on a signed path through the trees. This soon leads up to a track, which once again swings right - again take the path straight ahead.\n\nThe path climbing up through the birchwoods is a delight, crossing a couple of small bridges and later a stile. After a second stile the trees are left behind and the Ben Lawers National Nature reserve is entered by a sign. Beyond it the path passes through an area dotted with old shielings, where folk once would have lived during the summer months. Further on the path descends into the deep gully of the Lawers burn; leave it before this at a small cairn and keep high above the burn on its east side.\n\nThe path fades out but becomes clearer once more as the ground steepens for the grassy climb up Sròn Mhòr - the southern shoulder of Meall Greigh. Once above Sròn Mhòr there is a short peaty section before the ascent continues up the south ridge. The recompense for the effort is in the fine views of Loch Tay behind.\n\nMeall Greigh is rather a sprawling and shapeless Munro but its slightly detached position at the eastern end of the Lawers Range makes it an extensive viewpoint. Most eyes will be drawn west along the broad ridge to be followed to Meall Garbh, backed by steep An Stùc and massive Ben Lawers behind, with the tiny Lochan nan Cat cradled in front of them.\n\nDescend along the ridge - which is more of a moorland at this point - with a fenceline soon joining in from the right. Continue down to the bealach of Lairig Innein, where there is some wetter going in places. Beyond the bealach continue up the grassy slopes ahead.\n\nHigher up the ridge becomes better defined and curves round to the left to reach a rocky minor peak; continue beyond this to reach the cairn at the summit of Meall Garbh itself. This second Munro of the day is a mighty 1118 metres, its summit on second of the two parallel little ridges along the top. Ben Lawers now looms much closer but all eyes will be drawn to the next peak on the ridge - An Stùc - which rises intimidatingly steeply from the next bealach.\n\nContinue down the ridge to its foot. The ascent to this peak is a steep scramble and somewhat loose - great care is required, particularly in the wet. In winter this ascent can be very difficult indeed. The cairn at the summit will probably be reached with some relief. At 1118 metres An Stùc is exactly the same height as Meall Garbh; for many years this led to controversy as only the latter peak had Munro status. All was resolved in 1997 when An Stùc was itself promoted to be a Munro as well. Its status is well deserved as this is the finest peak in the Lawers range.\n\nContinue down the easier south ridge to reach Bealach Dubh. From here a decision must be made. It is possible to continue and include Ben Lawers to make a fine circuit of Lochan nan Cat, descending along its east ridge and then northeast to regain the path up to the corrie. Others (probably having climbed Lawers before) will have had enough, and will instead turn left at the bealach, following a rather winding path down an initial steep section of the descent.\n\nThere is a short grassy interlude before a final very steep descent down to the lochan - great care is needed. From here continue east along the exit stream, following it to a dam used by the Lawers hydro scheme. A track leaves here - follow it for a brief distance before onto a clear path that keeps high above the Lawers ravine. Further on the path descends into the ravine and crosses it before rejoining the outward route and leading back to the start.",

    "description": "There is a tarmac car park at Kilfinnan, part of which is available to walkers even during the hydro construction project. Begin the walk by crossing the bridge and following the Great Glen Way track which heads to the right uphill. Soon the track enters the forest and passes the entrances to a couple of groups of chalets.\n\nWhen the track forks, take the right fork (also the Great Glen Way) and continuing on the track which rises gently through the trees. Eventually the track descends very slightly, and after about two and a half kilometres beyond the fork there is a boulder and a footpath sign on the right of the track; this is the place to turn off right onto the footpath.\n\nThe well constructed path climbs steeply through the dense forest. Eventually it passes through a gate, and beyond this it becomes stony as it climbs through an area of natural birchwoods. There is a fine waterfall almost hidden by the trees down to the left. All trees are soon left behind and the 'Cam Bhealach' path continues clearly along the north side of the valley of the Allt Glas Doire, aiming for the narrow pass between the two hills. This route follows the line of an old 'Coffin Road' and was used by crofters from the remote region to the north to carry their dead to the graveyard at Kilfinnan. Continue right up to the bealach itself.\n\nBoth Munros are readily climbed from here. Sròn a' Choire Garbh rises steeply on the north side of the bealach, but there is an excellent stalkers path which zig-zags to and fro up the slope, making the ascent much easier.\n\nEventually the stalkers path ends; continue up across grassy open slopes to reach the edge of the broken cliffs above Coire Garbh. Bear left to make the final short walk northwest along the edge to reach the summit cairn. Sròn a' Choire Ghairbh is 937m, and gives impressive views looking northeast along the Great Glen, as well as over towards the Knoydart mountains.\n\nMost eyes, however, will be drawn to the next Munro, Meall na Teanga, backed by Ben Nevis. Retrace your steps all the way back down the stalkers' path to return to the bealach.\n\nThis time head south from the bealach, initially up a steep and worn path. This climbs above a gully before cutting across the slopes to reach a broad grassy bealach between Meall Dubh and Meall na Teanga. From here the path climbs steeply once more before cutting across the slope to gain the broad north ridge of Meall na Teanga. Turn south along this to reach the summit. There are excellent views down to Loch Lochy far below. A\n\nAt 918m Meall na Teanga is one of the smaller Munros, but it has a better view than its higher neighbour - with Ben Nevis and Loch Linnhe being very well seen in good conditions, whilst a narrow ridge leads on towards its southwestern summit - Meall Coire Lochain.\n\nRetrace your steps once more back down to the bealach, and then follow the coffin path back into the forest and return to Kilfinnan.",

    "description": "There is a car park just north of the house on the east side of the A835 just south of Inverlael Bridge. Start by going back out the car park entrance and then turning sharp right onto a track. Continue along the track towards the hills, with distant views towards Loch Broom to your left. Soon the track leads through a gate and into the Inverlael plantation. Ignore a track that heads off down the left and then one off up to the right. After 2km the track dips to cross a bridge over the river. Further on a track forks off left for Seana Bhràigh, one of the remotest Munros; our route continues up the main track through the forestry.\n\nAfter another kilometre a large turning area is reached, and the route continues on a path. This almost immediately exits the forestry at a gate and the walk now improves greatly as the route follows an old stalkers path up Gleann na Sguaib. Height is gained gradually on the excellent path which keeps well to the left above the burn, with grand views to Beinn Dearg ahead. After another couple of kilometres the path forks; the left path heads up towards Eididh nan Clach Geala and is used on the return, but our route keeps to the main glen path ahead.\n\nThere are impressive cliffs across the glen as Coire Mathair Lathail is reached and a burn is crossed at a confluence. The path now ascends between the two burns to eventually ascend up to Lochan Lathail, a truly beautiful spot. Beyond the lochan the path - which extends far beyond what is shown on some OS maps, despite a couple of indistinct stretches - climbs once more in a series of zig-zags to reach the barren, stony Bealach an Lochain Uaine. There is another series of small lochans here, and the bealach is the junction of several routes.\n\nOur route ascends Beinn Dearg first. To do so, head southeast across the wide bealach to meet a massive stone wall. Turn right alongside this, soon climbing steeply beside the wall and up over some bouldery ground. There are great views back over the bealach. The ascent is strenuous but the slope eventually eases; when you reach a corner where the wall turns right pass through a gap and aim slightly west of south to reach the huge summit cairn.\n\nAt 1084 metres this is the highest Munro north of the A835. The views are superb and very extensive with countless mountains in view; An Teallach is well seen to the northwest, whilst Loch Broom stretches away towards Assynt and Coigach. The photo shows the distant Torridon peaks seen over Loch a' Bhroain. Return to the wall and retrace your steps back down the steep slopes.\n\nThe second Munro to climb is Cona' Mheall. At the end of the wall, pass to the right of a small lochan and then follow a rough path that traverses the southern slopes of a hillock before descending to the east to reach a lower bealach. From here there are magnificent views south into Coire Ghranda with its fine loch. Beyond this bealach the ascent of Cona Mheall is up a wide open slope of grass and scree, with a final boulderfield before the summit, though a faint path helps avoid the worst of the boulders. For many years this was said to have been one of the only Munros with no summit cairn, but there is a small cairn at the 980 metre top today; but no man-made constructions can detract from the wild views across the Coire to the cliffs of Beinn Dearg. Retrace your steps back down to the first bealach and then back to Lochan Uaine.\n\nThis time, ascend the ridge which heads northwest from Lochan Uaine itself, ignoring a stalkers path that heads north. Keep the steep drop on your left and continue up the slope that leads easily to the third Munro of the day, Meall nan Ceapraichean. Continue over the minor bump of Ceann Garbh. The descent from here can be tricky if the best route isn't taken - head east towards a dip before cutting down. There is stony ground and boulders, and several bands of crags; eventually a path can be picked up that descends along the top of one of these lines of crags that slopes down to the next bealach.\n\nThe climb up to Eididh nan Clach Geala is on easier on mostly grassy slopes. There are two cairns - the first is the highest, but the second cairn a short distance beyond is the finest viewpoint. If you are lucky with the weather and light conditions, this fourth and lowest Munro at 928 metres is a great place to enjoy the spectacular view northwest to the mountains of Coigach and Assynt, with Stac Pollaidh prominent.\n\nContinue the walk by descending the west ridge for almost a kilometre before dropping steeply southwards to join up with a stalkers path coming down from Loch a Chnapaich, with great views back to Beinn Dearg and Meall nan Ceapraichean. Follow this stalkers path downhill until it rejoins the outward route in Gleann na Sguaib, then turn right to return to the start by the route of ascent.",

Head down this track and over the bridge over the picturesque River Etive. Beyond this a junction is reached - keep right here and follow the hydro track. At Coiletir a sign indicates a path round the cottage to the left; this route then follows a fenceline across the hillside to NN138457, but it's extremely boggy. It's better to stay on the hydro track that bypasses Coiletir to the right. Eventually the track reaches the Allt Mheuran. Don't cross the bridge but head up the left side of the burn; this section is overgrown and tussocky but for a much shorter distance than the direct route to NN138457.\n\nSoon you'll see a series of waterfalls above the confluence of the Allt Meirleach and the Allt Mheuran, and the going becomes slightly easier. The path eventually comes closer and then runs beside the Allt Mheuran above the gorges. Continue on the path up the valley; there are good views across to Ben Starav and the conical peak of Glas Bheinn Mhor, and waterslides and small falls in the stream add interest on the long ascent to the bealach between Glas Bheinn Mhòr and Stob Coir'an Albanaich.\n\nClimb the steep slope of grass and stones to the north to reach a flat shoulder. Stob Coir'an Albannaich can now be seen as a gentle dome ahead across a shallow depression; the easiest ascent is to contour round to the left to avoid the dip before ascending the slope to the ridge. At the top of this slope the landscape changes completely as the hill collapses on its northern side into deep, slabby corries. Turn right along the rim of these cliffs to reach the summit. This is the first Munro of the day, at 1044metres; there is a large, old grassy-grown cairn topped by a smaller, newer one, and a grand view of the Glencoe hills.\n\nThe traverse to the next Munro involves some convoluted route-finding which would be tricky in mist. Descend the initially steep and well-defined eastern ridge to where it begins to level off. The route down to the bealach involves turning left down a rake through the cliffs. There are two such rakes; the first is just before a rocky knobble - do not turn down this one, but continue a little further along the ridge to a second rake. This may be marked by a cairn and has a fair path starting down it; initially the path descends some slabby rocks before bearing left slightly to the descend a grassy gulley to the bealach.\n\nFrom the bealach, ascend the intervening peak of Meall Tarsuinn, which has large areas of flat rocky slabs. A path descends the far side of Beinn Tarsuinn, winding between steeper slabs, to reach a second bealach. From here, the ascent up onto the broad, grassy dome of Meall nan Eun is more straightforward in good visibility. The summit, which is over to the right, is at 928 metres making it the second Munro of the day; without this status this peak would be little visited. There is a good view towards Loch Tulla and the Bridge of Orchy mountains, though the sprawling plateau robs the view of any depth.\n\nHead northwest back across the plateau and continue down the steep slopes of the hill into Coire Riabhach. This slope has many steep crags and finding a safe route down the grass between them requires great care. Further down, continue across the less steep but very rough, tussocky terrain to reach the Allt Ceitlin. After the rough going, a hydro track is reached. Follow this down to Glen Etive, through two gates. Turn left along this track to a junction with another track; turn right here to head back across the bridge over the River Etive and return to the start.",

    "description": "Park at the Ben Lawers car park (parking charge). The walk begins along a well-made new path that begins from the lower end of the car park. Very soon turn right and the path now climbs gently uphill, with good views across to the Ben Lawers range, before reaching a track. Go straight across this onto a path which leads west up the slopes until it gains a ridge which is then followed northwards; there are great views looking back over Loch Tay. Continue up the grassy ridge to the pointed peak at 923 metres.\n\nThere are stunning views to the right of the nearby Ben Lawers range looking very fine across the deep trough of Lochan na Lairige. Cross a slight dip and a flat grassy area before the path begins to ascend again, this time tackling the steep and rocky upper slopes ahead. Soon the path swings to the right below the ridge before curving up to reach the it a short distance to the north of the cairn, finally turning left along the ridge to complete the ascent.\n\nAt 1044 metres this is a substantial Munro but the high start can make it one of the quickest ascents in the Highlands. It is a great viewpoint, with the Lawers range to the east, Loch Tay south, the Glen Lyon ranges to the north. For some Munro-baggers this summit is enough and they return the same way. However if conditions are good and you can manage a bit of careful navigation on the descent, a complete traverse of the rocky, winding Tarmachan ridge - stretching away to the southwest - is not to be missed.\n\nThe next objective is the sharply pointed peak of Meall Garbh. Descend the ridge which leads gently downhill to the south at first slowly curving to the right and passing a tiny lochan - with a larger one down to the right. The path simplifies navigation in the complex terrain; a minor hummock is passed before a rougher climb up towards the tiny summit of Meall Garbh.\n\nJust before the summit it is possible to leave the main ridge via a faint path leading down the side ridge on the south side. To continue the full traverse, stay on the main path, which soon leads along a fine grassy arête which is the narrowest part of the whole Tarmachan ridge.\n\nAfter the narrow section the path becomes rocky and descends to reach the top of a rocky scramble (Grade 1) which heads down diagonally to the right. When dry this is not too difficult, but it is easily avoided in summer by a bypass path on the right which leaves the main path a little above the scramble, and rejoins it immediately below.\n\nAnother minor hummock in the bealach is crossed before the ascent to the next top, Beinn an Eachan, which has a very steep south face. The tiny summit cairn reveals a fine view down Glen Lochay. Continue along the ridge, bearing right a little to avoid steep ground on the descent to the next bealach which is reached by following the clear ridge path.\n\nFrom the lowest bealach it is possible to include the final Top - Creag na Caillich - by continuing along the path, but if you do this then return to the bealach as it gives the easiest route of descent. The first part of the descent is rough, boggy and a little featureless so careful navigation is needed. Head southeast down wet but mostly grassy slopes; there are traces of a faint path in places. The aim is to reach the bend in the quarry track shown on the map - but out of sight at first. Once on the track follow it easily round the southern flanks of the ridge, ignoring branches off to the right. Eventually the outward path is joined; turn right down this to return to the car park.",

Ignore the track that heads left to a mast, and keep left at the fork a short distance further on, with a Càrn Ban Mòr stone marker. Follow this path to reach a gate at the edge of a plantation. Pass through the gate; the path immediately forks; take the main, left hand branch. This climbs quite steeply through the trees before reaching more open ground above; there are stunning views up Glen Feshie over to the right.\n\nThe path, which is very clear and well worn, climbs around the hillside towards the col between point 783 metres and Càrn Ban Mòr ; it then continues up the ridge, soon joined by an older path which zig-zags up from the slope below. The views back across Badenoch are superb, with a vast array of mountains in clear weather. Creag Meagaidh is easily identified by the deep gash of the Window to the right of its summit. The path comes close to a tiny stream before swinging slightly to the left (ignore the faint trod up beside the stream). Further on is a more obvious path junction, marked by a cairn; take the right hand option here. A left turn is a possible start to an ascent of Sgòr Gaoith.\n\nThe path has now crossed the watershed and there are good views of the Cairngorms giants such as Braeriach and the distinctive flat-topped cone of Cairn Toul. The path heads downhill to the southeast, before climbing towards spot height 957 metres on the OS map; it is worth following uphill to avoid a bog. This is the heart of the Moine Mhor, a great wild plateau that extends for many kilometres; unfortunately the wilderness feel is rather spoiled when an ugly constructed landrover track is reached. Turn left down this track (to the right it heads for Coire Garbhlach and Mullach Clach a'Bhlàir).\n\nThe track descends to the east before ending quite abruptly just short of a grassy ravine carrying the headwaters of the River Eidart. Continue directly across this (or bear left to cross slightly higher up before swinging back) - the burn can usually be crossed using stones. Ascend the bog on the far side and then head ESE to reach the featureless bealach marked as point 876 metres on OS maps. Faint grassy vehicle tracks continue from here, bypassing the cairn on the summit of Tom Dubh, one of Britain's remotest tops.\n\nContinue east downhill (grassy tyre tracks help avoid the bogs) to reach the Allt Luinneag. This is a surprisingly substantial burn to find at such an altitude, and often requires a paddle across; in spate, it could be difficult or dangerous. On the far side, continue east, now climbing uphill across slopes of grass interspersed with granite rocks, to gain the very broad north ridge of Monadh Mòr . Follow this SSE for a kilometre to reach the cairn on the summit. The views are extensive, with the Devil's Point guarding the left side of Glen Geuchasan which stretches away to the east, backed by Deeside and mighty Lochnagar. Beinn Bhrotain is also now visible, a bouldery dome defended with crags on its northern flanks.\n\nCheck the time at this point as if Beinn Bhrotain is included in the walk it is necessary to return all the way back over Monadh Mòr . If going for it a faint path passes to the left of the 1110m top before becoming clear on the steep descent to the narrow bealach at 975 metres. The views to the left here of Glen Geusachan are the most dramatic of the walk.\n\nThe path continues up the far side for some distance before reaching the vast boulder fields; continue up the boulders directly to reach the summit of Beinn Bhrotain, marked by two large windshelter cairns, one of them protecting a trig point. The views are even more extensive than those from Monadh Mòr .\n\nIf transport is not a problem then it is possible to descend the southeastern flanks and walk out to the Linn of Dee - which is a huge distance from Glen Feshie by road. The quickest return to Glen Feshie is to retrace your steps all the way back, including the reascent of Monadh Mòr and across the flanks of Carn Ban Mòr . The very fit could extend the route slightly by following the landrover track that eventually descends by Coire Garbhlach, perhaps detouring to the summit of Mullach Clach a'Bhlàir. If the weather is kind then the walk back may be greatly enjoyed, but if the wind gets up or the mists roll in, it will be a battle.",

    "description": "Park in the layby on the south side of the A890 1km west of the bridge over the Allt Coire Crubaidh. Follow the path through the gate down to the bridge over the river. Continue on the far side to eventually pass underneath the railway. From here, the bog trot begins! Pass through the gate ahead, keeping right at a faint forkin the path. From here a path continues up the hillside, aiming for and passing through a gate in the deer fence.\n\nIf there is no mist, you should be able to see the great gullies which score the wide face of the mountain; the path heads directly up the slope to the left of the section scored by two gullies which run close together near the top. Take care near the gully edges as the path is unstable. When the steep section is reached the going finally becomes drier underfoot, and there are good views back to the peaks of the Couilin Forest. Eventually the slope relents to a gentler graident once more, over soggy wet grasses.\n\nContinue straight ahead southeast to finally reach the broad ridge of Moruisg. Now turn along the ridge towards the summit; a large, well-built cairn is passed shortly before reaching the true summit cairn. On a clear day the view is just reward for the somewhat soggy ascent, with the great peaks of Torridon rising behind the Coulin Forest, whilst with good visibility the view takes in a vast swathe of Scotland from An Teallach and the Fannichs to the mountains of Skye.\n\nThe walk now changes character and becomes much more enjoyable. Follow the broad ridge southwest to reach the top of the crags of Coire Toll nam Bian. The ridge then turns south, keeping the crags close by and losing a little height before traversing a minor bump. Later the ridge curves southwest once more and descends more steeply down rockier ground to the bealach.\n\nFrom the bealach, climb straight west up the opposite slope to reach the lower shoulder of Sgùrr nan Ceannaichean. Once on the shoulder follow the ridge as it curves south to reach a steeper final climb - a good path eases the ascent here, up to a small summit plateau. There\\'s a large cairn at the centre of this, but the true summit is the smaller cairn just to the south, on the edge of a steep drop overlooking the empty upper reaches of Gleann Fhiodhaig. The summit was once a Munro but was demoted to Corbett status following a resurvey.\n\nReturn your steps back down to the shoulder, and then follow the ridge which descends north from here. The descent is mostly grassy, with some steeper sections. Further down the ridge is the rocky bluff of Creag a'Chait; this is avoided by keeping to the left side of the crags. Once below this steep descent, head northeast to reach the Alltan na Feola burn; cross it and then follow the path downsteam above the far bank.\n\nThe path becomes clearer and leads through a gate into an area of regenerating native woodland, keeping above the east side of the Allt an na Feola. The going becomes wet for some time before improving again lower down. Eventually the path leads through two more gates before bearing right across a final - very wet - stretch of heathery ground to rejoin the outward route at the underpass beneath the railway. Pass through this and over the bridge to return to the start.",

    "description": "From the car park at Invermark, follow the road over the bridge and past the church on the right. Take the next right signed for Mount Keen and the Queen's Well and just before the house bear left following another sign and go through a gate to follow a track. The track leads out into the open glen, the sandstone tower of Invermark castle can be seen through the trees on the left. Built as a garrison fort by the local landowner it's function was to provide protection from Aberdeenshire cattle raiders who would use the traditional routes through the glens.\n\nThe track soon reaches an old metal gate, go through this and continue up the glen. The glen is a popular place to spot red deer especially during the annual rut in October. A track joins in from the left, and after the route continues closer by the river.\n\nEventually the granite arches of the Queen's Well come into view ahead. This was built over the site of a spring where Queen Victoria stopped on one of her pony treks in the Angus glens. Branch off onto a narrower path on the right to reach the well.\n\nTurn left to rejoin the track, then turn right along it, passing to the left of Invermark Cottage. The Easter Burn is crossed - easy in dry conditions but after heavy rains things could become more difficult. Just beyond, the track next crosses the Ladder Burn via an iron grid.\n\nContinue along the rough track as it heads up the Ladder Glen; higher up it begins to climb away from the burn and a zig-zig leads up onto the moorlands above. There are excellent views back down towards Glen Esk. Continue on the track and then the main path which heads north up the moors.\n\nAt a junction turn right on a constructed path - the left fork was the original route of the Mounth Road but these days the path over Mount Keen itself is the busier of the two routes. From here to the summit the path had become very eroded but it has been greatly repaired in recent years.\n\nThere a couple of rockier sections before bouldery summit cone of Mount Keen is topped by a trig point at 939 metres. This is the most easterly of the Munros, but the surrounding landscape is one of vast, sweeping moorland rather than mountains. Lochnagar to the west gives a glimpse of more craggy terrain.\n\nIf returning to Glen Esk the usual way back is to retrace your steps. If transport permits it is possible instead to continue north, finally finishing in Glen Tanar to make a fine traverse - but Glen Tanar is many, many miles from Invermark by public road!",

    "summary": "Liathach is rated by many mountaineers and hillwalkers as Scotland's finest mountain, challenged only by An Teallach and the Cuillin of Skye. Its traverse is an expedition that will be remembered forever.",
    "description": "There is space for several cars to park at the start of the path a couple of hundred metres east of Glen Cottage; there are more spaces slightly nearer the cottage. Liathach looms high overhead from here, looking impossible to climb, but there is actually a well-made path to begin with. This starts from the layby just west of the Allt an Doire Ghairbh stream, soon crossing it and then climbing steeply up the far bank.\n\nThere is a minor bit of scrambling and the path is consistently steep until it begins to ease into the coire of Toll a' Meitheach. The respite from the steepness is short, however, as soon the path begins climbing relentlessly once more; when the route ahead appears blocked the path swings to the right. There are a couple of short simple rocky scrambles where the path climbs up through weaknesses in the sandstone terraces.\n\nThe path reaches the ridge a little southwest of Stùc a' Choire Dhubh Bhig at a point marked by a cairn. The sudden view down the other side of the mountain into the wild country on the north side of Torridon takes the breath away. Before heading for the summit, it is worth detouring out to the top of Stùc a' Choire Dhubh Bhig - the easternmost summit on the ridge - for a great view of Beinn Eighe across the deep trench of Coire Dubh, as well as a better perspective on the grand ridge ahead to Spidean a' Choire Lèith. Return to the cairn at the top of the both and continue along the ridge towards the summit.\n\nContinue along the main ridge on the well-worn path, crossing the two tops of Stob a'Choire Liath Mhor, the first of which has a wind-shelter cairn. The summits are littered with quartzite boulders which make for slow going, but the situation is spectacular. After the second summit there is a short descent before the longer climb up the impressive summit cone of Spidean a'Choire Lèith, which is covered with more angular boulders.\n\nThe summit - the highest point on the whole Liathach ridge - is a sensational viewpoint, with the full ridge of the mountain now being revealed. On the descent from Spidean a' Choire Lèith great care in poor visibility to both avoid following the ridge which heads SSE to end in a precipitous prow which projects out from the mountain or to end up descending towards crags above Coire na Caime. Instead the true route heads briefly south then southwest down a steep slope of massive boulders to reach a narrow bealach.\n\nThe sight ahead should set the pulses racing, as the next section of the ridge is riven into the famous Am Fasarinen pinnacles. If all these are traversed along the crest there is a conseridable amount of exposed scrambling to negotiate. Alternatively there is a path which traverses along natural shelves below the pinnacles on the south side to avoid the scrambling, but it is sensationally exposed, particularly at a couple of spots where it also tends to be wet. You might be able to see your parked car when looking down between your feet! Great care is needed as any slip would be fatal. This section continues for several hundred metres.\n\nThe path rejoins the ridge just beyond the last pinnacle. The ridge now changes character completely and leads without further obstacle (albeit with huge cliffs plunging on the right) uphill to the second Munro of Mullach an Rathain. The summit gives a wonderful view back of the entire ridge, as well as into the wild country on the north side of the mountain.\n\nThe view west is a complete contrast, dominated by Beinn Alligin and the glittering waters of Loch Torridon, with Skye and the other islands beyond if the day is clear. To begin the descent follow the line of a stony path southwest diagonally downhill from Mullach an Rathain towards a shoulder, before heading left to descend the very steep earthy/scree slope; there is a zig-zag path which helps a little but this part of the descent is trying.\n\nFurther down the path begins to improve, and has even been pitched with stone steps in places. It continues down to the grassy floor of Toll Ban for a brief respite in the very steep descent - but you are still less than half way down at this point! Soon the path steepens once more, keeping close by the burn at first before bearing right away from it. There are a few slight scrambly sections in places as the path winds around to find a route through the terraces of sandstone cliffs to return to the Torridon road, two kilometres west of where you started.",

    "description": "Take the road up the east side of Glen Feshie (signed Achlean); just after the road leaves the forest there is a car park on the left, about a kilometre short of Achlean itself, where parking is not permitted. Begin the walk along the tarmac road, turning left on a track before reaching Achlean. Ignore the track that heads left to a mast, and keep right at the fork a short distance further on (marked Upper Glen Feshie on the boulder). Soon the path goes through a gate; just beyond a fast-flowing burn is reached. This must be forded, which is usually fairly straightforward but it could be tricky or even impassable after heavy rain. Beyond, the path runs along the edge of a heather bank elevated above the flood plain of the river. Ignore a path that forks off right towards a bridge over the river, and continue ahead.\n\nContinue on the path until a fork; bear left here onto a smaller path (the main path ahead where the Allt Garbhlach meets the Feshie has been washed out). Keep left when a path joins from the right, soon reaching and crossing the Allt Garbhlach (often a ford, though logs sometimes placed in summer). On the far side the path soon forks - keep left to continue into the the trees. At a grassy track turn right, then keep straight ahead (ignoring paths off right and left); the well surfaced main path joins the grassy track. Bear left at a fork. The path rises through the pines and heather before descending to join a track - turn right along this.\n\nAfter 400m ignore the path off right, which again has been destroyed further on by flooding. Eventually on a cross-roads of tracks is reached; turn left here. The track begins to ascend up from the floor of the glen and soon the pinewoods are left behind. The track begins to climb high above Coire Caol before heading towards a little bealach on the left hand ridge between Meall nan Steac and Cadha na Coin Duibh.\n\nThe track itself is something of a scar on the landscape, but short detours to the rim of the corrie to your left reveal some spectacular views down into Coire Garbhlach. The track skirts the side of Cadha na Coin Dhuibh before coming close to the edge for even more dramatic views. Continue the ascent onto the flat plateau, where the landrover track eventually forks.\n\nTake the right hand fork and follow it for about three quarters of a kilometre before leaving the track to follow a fainter path for the final gentle ascent to the cairn on Mullach Clach a'Bhair at 1019m. The flat terrain robs the view of any depth, the most impressive feature probably being the vastness of the soggy plateau stretching across to Braeriach and Càrn Toul.\n\nThere are several options for the descent; probably easiest is to return the same way; another popular option is to traverse the rolling plateau to the north to reach Sgòr Gaoith and include another Munro in the day, before returning down the Hunter's Path from the south flank of Càrn Ban Mòr to Achlean. A third option is using the stalkers path down Coire nam Bo, which is beautiful but has become very overgrown and completely lost in its lowest reaches. The simplest alternative descent is to instead follow a faint ATV track that initially descends southwest down the Druim nam Bo ridge. It passes round the southern side of Lochan nam Bo before rising slightly as it turns N.\n\nSoon the track bears NNW. It becomes much clearer for a time, and is quite eroded on a couple of steeper sections; below these it is almost lost briefly in a boggy area.\n\nFurther down the ATV track easily fords the Allt Coire nam Meur, and then the Allt Choire Dhomhain. The final stretch leads through magnificent regenerating native forest of Scots pines and juniper, but is a little overgrown. It rejoins the outward route at the clear cross-tracks at the floor of the glen. Take the track that leads northwards and retrace your steps from the outward route all the way back to Achlean and the start.",

The effort required is fully repaid, however, as this is a spectacular region of dramatic peaks and ridges - the views from the summits are often claimed to be the finest in Scotland.

    "description": "The walk is described from Shenavall bothy; this can be reached via a walk-in from Corrie Hallie as described on the Shenavall route. The bothy is maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting. An alternative is to wild-camp; there is a great spot in the alder woods at NH088788; this is best reached by following the track used as the way back on the Shenavall circuit.\n\nFrom Shenavall Beinn a' Chlaidheimh rises extremely steeply across Strath na Sealga; although it is possible to make a direct assault many walkers will prefer to head up the strath and then approach it from the east, so start along the path which leads ESE. It becomes a track near the ruined house at Achneigie. Continue for another 1.5km - the alder woodland over to the right makes a great spot for a wild camp - until the track begins to climb to the left (bound for Corrie Hallie); instead follow a fainter, grassy track which heads west at this point and leads alongside the Abhainn Loch an Nid. This river must be waded - as with two river crossings at the end of the walk, this is not possible if the level is high.\n\nOn the far side, head directly up the slopes of Beinn Chlaidheimh. After wet but steep heather initially the slope eases to a more gradual grind until the much fiercer upper slopes are reached around 500m. Pass just left of the crags that guard the nose of the main ridge, making your way up steep heather as soon as practical to reach the ridge above at a flattish shoulder. There is then a brief climb up easy scree to gain the narrow summit ridge at point 900m. Follow this airy but grassy ridge across a slight dip to reach the summit cairn, with great views down the very steep west face into the strath, as well as back over the pinnacles of An Teallach. The descent begins almost immediately, with a path down the scree slope to a first bealach at 787m. Continue over a broad and bumpy section of ridge before a second descent leads down to a lower bealach at 650m, marked by a couple of lochans.\n\nContinue south up rough quartzite boulders to gain the very broad NE ridge of Sgùrr Ban. The ridge is littered with rough boulders all the way up the long pull to the top; there is grassier ground further right but this leads onto steeper terrain higher up. The summit cairn is in the centre of a small plateau but the walk continues in the same direction, heading down fairly straightforward slopes to reach the bealach at Cab Coire nan Clach. The next Munro, Mullach Coire Mhic Fhearchair, rises in intimidatingly steep slopes. However, there is an eroded path which leads up scree for the steepest part of the climb, and in good weather it can easily be picked out on the descent from Sgùrr Ban. The slope then eases and continues - still over stones and boulders - to the summit, the highest of the Fisherfield 6.\n\nThe descent is less steep, leading SW and then S, but even more covered with quartzite boulders which make it more time consuming. From the bealach beyond, the steep 851m peak of Meall Garbh appears to be a formidable obstacle, but a bypass path avoids this by cutting across its very steep NW slope to reach a second, lower bealach. From here the slopes of Beinn Tarsuinn are broad and mostly grassy, hiding the drama of the other side of this mountain, which is revealed only as the summit cairn is reached. Follow the narrow ridge to the left to soon reach a square tilted platform which sits astride the mountain and has been likened to a tennis court. A path scrambles easily up onto the 'Tennis Court' to reach a cairn at the far end before descending once more. The next section of ridge is riven into a series of pinnacles, but the walk continues by taking a clear bypass path which runs around the left side.\n\nContinue along the bypass path until a clear path forks off left very steeply down the loose slope. This leads to the extensive and very boggy bealach between Beinn Tarsuinn and A' Mhaighdean - the lowest point of the walk at 525m. The pull up to A' Mhaighdean from here is a very long grind up a broad, grassy slope - a real effort for tired legs. The lure is what is regarded as the remotest of all Munros - and perhaps the finest Munro summit view. The highest point is right on the edge of an abyss as the slopes to the west plunge for 800m down dramatic crags to the Dubh Loch, with Fionn Loch and the sea beyond and amazing rock architecture all around. The view south down to Gorm Loch Mòr and the crags of Beinn Lair is scarcely less impressive, and summiting A' Mhaighdean must be ranked amongst the highlights of a round by any Munroist.\n\nHead towards the more dome-like northern top before descending steep but largely grassy slopes and then rocky ground to reach the Poll Eadar dha Stac, the pass at the foot of Ruadh Stac Mòr . There is a very rough stone bivouac shelter here, which may be of use in an emergency. The last Munro of the round, Ruadh Stac Mòr , rises directly above and the route to it appears to be barred by a band of crags, whilst a stalkers path cuts off to the left to descend past Fuar Loch Mòr . A small cairn, however, marks the point to strike up the well-worn scree slope to reach the foot of the cliffs. The route through the crags above can be picked out during the descent from A' Mhaighdean; it heads up an eroded gully above the scree slope. Getting into the gully requires a straightforward scramble, best started slightly along a ledge to the right from the top of the scree path. From here a big scrambling step up leads onto a wide, well-worn stony gangway that slopes to the left and then continues up the gully before emerging on the boulderfields of the upper slopes.\n\nA faint path winds up the boulders and passes through a gap in the summit crags to reach the cairn. This is another superlative viewpoint in the very heart of the wilderness, surrounded by dramatic rock peaks and glistening lochans; to the north are the Lochan a'Bhragdad backed by the perfect cone of Beinn Dearg Bheag and the pinnacled ridges of Beinn Dearg Mòr beyond. Head along the NNW ridge - negotiating yet more boulderfields - for around 250m before aiming directly between the two lochans to the NE. The slope is terraced with several steeper sections unseen from above. Pass between the lochans and continue north, following a burn down into the hanging valley below. Cross the burn and aim diagonally up the slope opposite to pick up an excellent stalkers path above the Clach na Frithealaidh - a prominent rock.\n\nFollow the path to the right. It angles down towards Loch Beinn Dearg before swinging back to lead easily down Gleann na Muice Beag, eventually leading down to a path running along the Abhainn Ghleann na Muice, a substantial river. Continue down this path to reach the chalet and cottage amidst the group of trees at Larachantivore. Wade the river near here - again, this is impossible in spate. The direct route back to Shenavall now crosses a severe bog, with great care needed to avoid stepping into one of many waist-deep, slime-filled pools, before reaching the second river, the Abhainn Strath na Sealga, just short of the bothy. Alternatively you could continue by the riverbank to the junction of the two rivers. Either way, the second river too needs to be waded before heading back to Shenavall.",

Walk east for a short distance along the road to the start of the signposted path through the An Caorann Mòr (about a kilometre and a half east of the Cluanie Inn). Walk up the first steep section of track; after around 50m look out for a faint path heading off on the right. From here the route makes an unrelenting and direct climb up the steep grassy slopes to the northeast. The angle relents at about 750m where you emerge on the south ridge of A'Chralaig.\n\nTurn left along the ridge, which climbs in stages and becomes better defined as height is gained. At about 1000m the ridge turns northwest and leads easily to the massive and well-built cairn on the summit of A' Chralaig (which rather puzzingly means The Basket). There is a commanding view of the whole area, with Loch Cluanie being seen full length. The ridge now briefly leads northwards before a steeper rocky descent northwest and a northerly continuation down to a bealacb.\n\nFrom the dip on the ridge, continue still with a clear path, crossing the 1008m top where it turns once more to the right to reach another col. From here the ridge goes north once more, and becomes very narrow. For part of the way the ridge crest is broken into a series of rocky towers; keen and able scramblers might cross these, but most walkers will use the clear bypass path which avoids them to the right before crossing back over the ridge and avoiding the last section to the left. Even the bypass path has one short rocky step but this shouldn't give most hillwalkers any difficulty.\n\nThe summit of Mullach Fraoch-Choire is a short distance beyond the difficulties. The second Munro of the day at 1102 metres has great views over the wilds at the head of Glen Affric though most walkers will most enjoy looking back along the ridge to A'Chralaig. From here, return back down the difficult section of ridge or bypass path, before leaving the ridge to the right at the col before the 1008 metre top. The descent is on a path down steep scree at first but the grassy upper reaches of Coire Odhar are soon reached.\n\nContinue the descent down Coire Odhar; it is possible to bear left slightly southwest lower down to shorten the walk back.

    "summary": "Strenuous walk over some of the remotest mountains in Britain. Sgùrr nan Ceathreamhnan is a magnificent peak; whilst Mullach na Dheiragain is prized for its inaccessibility.",
    "description": "The start of this walk is from Alltbeithe (also known as Glen Affric YHA), the remotest hostel in Britain. Allbeithe can only be reached on foot, and an overnight stop in the hostel, camping or at Camban bothy prior to this walk will be essential for most. The shortest approach is via the An Caorannmor from the Cluanie Inn. Far better approaches are by walking in from Glen Affric, or either of the two halves described in this circular route from Morvich, Kintail. To begin the walk from the hostel, take the path which leads out the back passing the separate dormitory building and the water supply.\n\nThe route bends to the right and crosses the Allt Beithe Min, and then the Allt na Faing. Just beyond this latter stream, the excellently constructed path passes through a gate in the deer fence and begins to climb, keeping to the east side of the stream. A good view back of the Alltbeithe hostel opens up as height is gained; further up the mountainside, a second deer fence is reached at another gate. Continue up the path; further on the surface deteriorates and the going becomes boggier as Coire na Cloiche is reached. Continue on the soggy path which climbs more gently up to the bealach (pass) at about 790 metres, with a view down the far side into desolate Gleann a'Choilich.\n\nFrom here, you need the decide which of the three peaks to tackle first. It seems a good idea to make it Mullach na Dheiragain, the remotest peak - Sgùrr na Ceathreamhnan can be bypassed on the route out and climbed on the way back. To do this, do not descend north from the bealach but head west along the ridge for about two hundred metres first. At this point what looks at first like a small stream bed leads northwest off the ridge, leading to traces of a path descending fairly steeply northwest. Once down to the 750 metre contour, turn west heading for the outflow at the bottom of the Loch Coire nan Dearcag lochans. These lochans are set in a grand, remote corrie, backed by crags. Crossing the boggy area below them is relatively straightforward; now head northwest up straightforward slopes to reach the Bealach nan Daoine.\n\nAt the pass you will meet a path along the ridge; turn right along it. It climbs up towards the Top of Càrn na Con Dhu. The summit area of this peak can be confusing in mist are there are various knobbly undulations. Towards the northeast end, a short boulder field is crossed and after that the ridge narrows, with steep slopes on the right, and the way is clearer, descending in two sections to reach the Bealach na Con Dhu. Continue along the ridge, heading up the wide and sprawling slopes of Mullach na Dheiragain. The path seems to wander off left rather than ascending, so strike out directly up the slope to locate the summit cairn towards the far end. Mullach na Dheiragain is a Munro at 982 metres, and is one of the least accessible of all Britain's peaks. Reaching it from and returning to any roadside starting point inside a day is a feat for supermen only, so its summit is a real prize, even if the summit area lacks distinction.\n\nReturn back down the ridge, crossing the Bealach na Con Dhu and Càrn na Con Dhu, to return to the Bealach nan Daoine. This time, continue along the ridge as it ascends once more. As height is gained the ridge narrows and steepens to give a fine route directly to the summit cairn of Sgùrr nan Ceathreamhnan. This is the highest Munro in the immediate area, at 1151 metres, and is at the apex of several ridges as well as being a very extensive viewpoint.\n\nThe summit ridge leading west from the cairn is narrow and dramatic, but the continuation of our walk is to descend the southeast ridge. This descends continuously at first before turning east and crossing several undulations and minor summits before reaching the bealach reached earlier, at the top of the path up from Alltbeithe.\n\nBefore descending back to Alltbeithe, it is straightforward to include the third Munro of An Socach in the itinerary. Continue east from the bealach, climbing briefly before crossing a flat area with several lochans. The dome of An Socach looms just beyond, and is easily ascended following the path.\n\nThe summit cairn is 921 metres, making it the smallest of the three summits. Return to the bealach, and then retrace the path back down to Alltbeithe via the Allt na Faing.",

    "description": "Park in the car park (charge) situated above the Glen Nevis road just before reaching the bridge at Polldubh. It is worth walking over to this bridge before starting the walk to have a good look at the Polldubh Falls (also known as the 'Lower Falls'), usually busy with coach parties - but the walk starts from the nearside of the bridge. Don't take the left hand path leading up beside the River Nevis itself, but instead take the right hand track through a gate. This becomes a path and keeps to the east side of the Allt Coire a'Mhusgain.\n\nThe path is muddy in places at first but follows the line of an old stalkers path and improves higher up. It climbs at a steady angle but fairly relentlessly, soon passing through another gate and then beneath the southwest ridge of Sgùrr a Mhaim, and keeping a fair distance above the stream in its deep ravine. The path climbs through some attractively scattered deciduous woodland before passing below a crag and then gaining a good deal of height in a series of zig-zags. It then traverses the east flank of the glen before climbing again in more zig-zags by a fine waterfall.\n\nThe path crosses a shallow upper corrie and climbs again to reach a broad bealach. Looking back, there are superb views back down the coire to Glen Nevis. To the east of the bealach is Sgòr an Iubhair (part of the Ring of Steall walk); but our route heads west up the ridge towards the impressive peak of Stob Ban.\n\nThe ridge is grassy at first narrowing, with the upper slopes of Stob Ban towering very impressively above. A path helps the ascent of the steep and shattered quartzite slopes above, keeping a little to the left initially on the climb up the final ridge which curves round above the dramatic northeast face of the mountain.\n\nThe gradient eases onto the summit of Stob Ban, which is a spectacular viewpoint; Ben Nevis looks its full height above the glen, whilst looking east the other Mamores peaks in view look magnificent. To continue the walk, follow the ridge northwards from the summit - the descent is initially over shattered quartzite rocks. You can either pass over or across the western flank of a rounded rocky knoll - both ways are equally rough underfoot.\n\nBelow this the quartzite thankfully relents and a grassier path is reached. It is possible to bypass the next knoll on the ridge - this is the culminating point of the north ridge of Stob Ban that continues for some distance before a precipitous plunge to the glen; rather than following this, our route heads for the 846m bealach to the west. Beyond this the straightforward ridge climbs up to a minor summit with a tiny area of quartzite rocks, and then continues along the ridge.\n\nFurther on the ridge narrows dramatically to a rocky crest - this can be traversed or bypassed on the left to reach another bealach. Beyond this the ridge broadens and climbs once more to a wide plateau at point 917m. There is then another short descent before the final rise to the massive cairn that marks the true summit of Mullach nan Coirean at 939m.\n\nThis flat-topped peak offers sensational views towards Loch Linnhe. Follow the ridge northwards from the summit before curving right onto the northeast ridge. The crest of the ridge leads down to eventually reach a fence and stile at 642m. Ignore the stile and continue down to the left of the fence. Further down is a second stile - again ignore this and keep left of the fence. The path now becomes very boggy and descends steeply by the fence towards the Allt a' Choire Riabhaich.\n\nNear the bottom cross a stile and follow a thankfully much drier path through some attractive native birchwoods and then through a felled area to gain a forest track. Head right along this, forking left downhill when a junction is reached. At the sharp bend ahead, take the good path which descends more directly through the trees to return to Achriabhach. Turn right along the road to return to the car park at the start.",

    "description": "The walk begins from the car park adjacent to St Paul's Church in Kinlochleven; it is signed 'Grey Mare's Tail' from the main road. From the car park follow the path into the woods; it is signed for 'Spean Bridge' and 'Corrour Station'. Almost at once the path reaches a t-junction; turn left here, then almost immediately fork right onto a rougher path up steps. This path now climbs steeply through the trees; ignore lesser paths on either side. When the path forks by a small burn fork left, crossing the burn. The route climbs up through the deciduous woodland and gives increasingly good views back over Kinlochleven and Loch Leven behind. The original zig-zagging stalkers path has been short-cutted by a variety of eroded, direct routes; it is best to keep to the old route to avoid worsening the erosion. Soon the trees are left behind and more open moorland is reached.\n\nContinue on the clear path across the moor until it approaches a vehicle track; it forks just before reaching it. Take the left fork, reaching the track and continuing straight across it on another stalkers' path. This path climbs across the moor, later crossing a stream and heading up the far bank before climbing around the southern flank of Sgùrr Èilde Beag. Watch out for a sharp zig-zag to the left uphill, as there is a peaty path continuing directly ahead which peters out before Loch Èilde Mòr . Above a few zig-zags the path contours once more, reaching a fork. Bear left here to head uphill, soon joining another old stalkers path coming in from the right.\n\nFollow this path as it climbs diagonally to the left; initially it crosses a landslipped area and requires care, but beyond this it continues as a very fine graded old path zig-zagging to find an easy route up an otherwise extremely steep slope. Eventually it reaches the ridge just short of Sgùrr Èilde Beag, and from here easy grass slopes lead up to the first minor peak. There are truly sensational views across to Sgùrr Èilde Mòr across the irregular loch of Coire nan Lochan far below.\n\nNow continue along the broad ridge - sometimes grassy, sometimes rocky, across a bealach where another stalkers path comes up from the right. Continue uphill along the ridge to climb to another top at 1062m. From here you can see the ridge running out to Binnein Mòr to the north backed by Ben Nevis and the Grey Corries.\n\nFollow this ridge northwards, dropping slightly to a bealach before ascending a fine ridge to reach the summit of Binnein Mòr . At 1130m this Munro is the highest of all the Mamores, and is a wonderful airy perch with spectacular views. The peak of Binnein Beag far below looks so small in comparison that it is hard to believe it is a Munro. Retrace your steps along the ridge back to the 1062m minor summit.\n\nThis time follow the narrowing ridge southwest - initially on grass, then shattered rock - down to a bealach. The ridge narrows in places but there are no real difficulties on the ascent to Na Gruagaichean, which is grassy initially before becoming very rocky.\n\nThe summit cairn is reached without too much ascent; at 1056m this is the second Munro of the day. The best part of the view is northwest, where the main Mamores ridge drops steeply and reascends even more dramatically to Na Gruagaichean's northwest Top, with Ben Nevis as backdrop.\n\nRather than heading over to this top, follow the easier south ridge which sweeps down to Leachd na h-Aire and gives great views down to Kinlochleven and Loch Leven. From the cairn on the Leachd, descend WSW down initially grassy ground. This soon steepens and there are traces of a path to ease the descent on the steep section, which ends with a crossing of boulders. Beyond the boulders the descent continues, now pathless.\n\nThis part of the descent is long and tiring, and care is needed with navigation; recompense is in the superb view of Loch Leven ahead. There is a deer fence before the Mamore Lodge - Loch Èilde Mòr track is reached; this is best avoided by keeping south in the later stages to meet the track near where it passes through the deer fence. Turn briefly left along the track, then turn right onto a path that soon heads through a gate in the fence lower down. Continue down this path that eventually leads down to the woods, descending to reach a footbridge near the Grey Mare's Tail. Turn left over this bridge and climb very briefly before rejoining the outward route just a few metres from the car park at the start.",

The effort required is fully repaid, however, as this is a spectacular region of dramatic peaks and ridges - the views from the summits are often claimed to be the finest in Scotland. The route is an epic round of all five Munros and one Corbett, starting and finishing at Shenavall bothy or a nearby wild camp.",
    "description": "The walk is described from Shenavall bothy; this can be reached via a walk-in from Corrie Hallie as described on the Shenavall route. The bothy is maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting. An alternative is to wild-camp; there is a great spot in the alder woods at NH088788; this is best reached by following the track used as the way back on the Shenavall circuit.\n\nFrom Shenavall Beinn a' Chlaidheimh rises extremely steeply across Strath na Sealga; although it is possible to make a direct assault many walkers will prefer to head up the strath and then approach it from the east, so start along the path which leads ESE. It becomes a track near the ruined house at Achneigie. Continue for another 1.5km - the alder woodland over to the right makes a great spot for a wild camp - until the track begins to climb to the left (bound for Corrie Hallie); instead follow a fainter, grassy track which heads west at this point and leads alongside the Abhainn Loch an Nid. This river must be waded - as with two river crossings at the end of the walk, this is not possible if the level is high.\n\nOn the far side, head directly up the slopes of Beinn Chlaidheimh. After wet but steep heather initially the slope eases to a more gradual grind until the much fiercer upper slopes are reached around 500m. Pass just left of the crags that guard the nose of the main ridge, making your way up steep heather as soon as practical to reach the ridge above at a flattish shoulder. There is then a brief climb up easy scree to gain the narrow summit ridge at point 900m. Follow this airy but grassy ridge across a slight dip to reach the summit cairn, with great views down the very steep west face into the strath, as well as back over the pinnacles of An Teallach. The descent begins almost immediately, with a path down the scree slope to a first bealach at 787m. Continue over a broad and bumpy section of ridge before a second descent leads down to a lower bealach at 650m, marked by a couple of lochans.\n\nContinue south up rough quartzite boulders to gain the very broad NE ridge of Sgùrr Ban. The ridge is littered with rough boulders all the way up the long pull to the top; there is grassier ground further right but this leads onto steeper terrain higher up. The summit cairn is in the centre of a small plateau but the walk continues in the same direction, heading down fairly straightforward slopes to reach the bealach at Cab Coire nan Clach. The next Munro, Mullach Coire Mhic Fhearchair, rises in intimidatingly steep slopes. However, there is an eroded path which leads up scree for the steepest part of the climb, and in good weather it can easily be picked out on the descent from Sgùrr Ban. The slope then eases and continues - still over stones and boulders - to the summit, the highest of the Fisherfield 6.\n\nThe descent is less steep, leading SW and then S, but even more covered with quartzite boulders which make it more time consuming. From the bealach beyond, the steep 851m peak of Meall Garbh appears to be a formidable obstacle, but a bypass path avoids this by cutting across its very steep NW slope to reach a second, lower bealach. From here the slopes of Beinn Tarsuinn are broad and mostly grassy, hiding the drama of the other side of this mountain, which is revealed only as the summit cairn is reached. Follow the narrow ridge to the left to soon reach a square tilted platform which sits astride the mountain and has been likened to a tennis court. A path scrambles easily up onto the 'Tennis Court' to reach a cairn at the far end before descending once more. The next section of ridge is riven into a series of pinnacles, but the walk continues by taking a clear bypass path which runs around the left side.\n\nContinue along the bypass path until a clear path forks off left very steeply down the loose slope. This leads to the extensive and very boggy bealach between Beinn Tarsuinn and A' Mhaighdean - the lowest point of the walk at 525m. The pull up to A' Mhaighdean from here is a very long grind up a broad, grassy slope - a real effort for tired legs. The lure is what is regarded as the remotest of all Munros - and perhaps the finest Munro summit view. The highest point is right on the edge of an abyss as the slopes to the west plunge for 800m down dramatic crags to the Dubh Loch, with Fionn Loch and the sea beyond and amazing rock architecture all around. The view south down to Gorm Loch Mòr and the crags of Beinn Lair is scarcely less impressive, and summiting A' Mhaighdean must be ranked amongst the highlights of a round by any Munroist.\n\nHead towards the more dome-like northern top before descending steep but largely grassy slopes and then rocky ground to reach the Poll Eadar dha Stac, the pass at the foot of Ruadh Stac Mòr . There is a very rough stone bivouac shelter here, which may be of use in an emergency. The last Munro of the round, Ruadh Stac Mòr , rises directly above and the route to it appears to be barred by a band of crags, whilst a stalkers path cuts off to the left to descend past Fuar Loch Mòr . A small cairn, however, marks the point to strike up the well-worn scree slope to reach the foot of the cliffs. The route through the crags above can be picked out during the descent from A' Mhaighdean; it heads up an eroded gully above the scree slope. Getting into the gully requires a straightforward scramble, best started slightly along a ledge to the right from the top of the scree path. From here a big scrambling step up leads onto a wide, well-worn stony gangway that slopes to the left and then continues up the gully before emerging on the boulderfields of the upper slopes.\n\nA faint path winds up the boulders and passes through a gap in the summit crags to reach the cairn. This is another superlative viewpoint in the very heart of the wilderness, surrounded by dramatic rock peaks and glistening lochans; to the north are the Lochan a'Bhragdad backed by the perfect cone of Beinn Dearg Bheag and the pinnacled ridges of Beinn Dearg Mòr beyond. Head along the NNW ridge - negotiating yet more boulderfields - for around 250m before aiming directly between the two lochans to the NE. The slope is terraced with several steeper sections unseen from above. Pass between the lochans and continue north, following a burn down into the hanging valley below. Cross the burn and aim diagonally up the slope opposite to pick up an excellent stalkers path above the Clach na Frithealaidh - a prominent rock.\n\nFollow the path to the right. It angles down towards Loch Beinn Dearg before swinging back to lead easily down Gleann na Muice Beag, eventually leading down to a path running along the Abhainn Ghleann na Muice, a substantial river. Continue down this path to reach the chalet and cottage amidst the group of trees at Larachantivore. Wade the river near here - again, this is impossible in spate. The direct route back to Shenavall now crosses a severe bog, with great care needed to avoid stepping into one of many waist-deep, slime-filled pools, before reaching the second river, the Abhainn Strath na Sealga, just short of the bothy. Alternatively you could continue by the riverbank to the junction of the two rivers. Either way, the second river too needs to be waded before heading back to Shenavall.",

    "summary": "Beinn Eighe is the bulkiest of the trinity of great Torridon peaks. The western half of its ridge contains both of its two Munros. This section of the ridge makes a fine traverse with magnificent views; it may involve less scrambling than Beinn Alligin or Liathach, but compensation comes when Coire Mhic Fhearchair is reached during the descent; this is the most spectacular of all Torridon's corries.",
    "description": "This classic circuit is described clockwise in most guides but the steep screes above Coire Mhic Fhearchair are marginally more tolerable if taken in descent, so an anti-clockwise circuit may be preferred. Park in the Coire Mhic Nobuil car park (where the path returns from the hill) and begin by walking 2km east along the road. Turn left on the track to the parking area at Coire an Laoigh, which is an alternative start / parking point (leaving the short road walk until the end). A cairn marks the start of the footpath up towards Coire na Laoigh.\n\nThe path climbs gently at first up the grassy slopes before steepening as it climbs up towards the corrie between the main ridge and the projecting spur of Stùc Coire an Laoigh. Great views open up looking back across Loch Bharranch to Sgùrr Dubh and the mountains of the Coulin Forest.\n\nMuch higher up the path reaches the grassy floor of Coire an Laoigh for a brief respite before beginning a very steep climb up the headwall to reach the ridge between Stùc Coire an Laoigh and Beinn Eighe itself. At this point there is a large cairn and a stunning sudden view ahead of Liathach - looking like an unassailable battleship. Turn right to continue the ascent, with the path winding its way up a mass of quartzite scree.\n\nThe main ridge is gained at an Ordnance Survey trig point at 972 metres. In misty conditions with careless navigation this could be mistaken for the first Munro of the day, Spidean Coire nan Clach, but in fact the summit involves a detour along the ridge to the right. The crest is narrow and composed of quartzite, but a path leads along to the true summit, bypassing a rocky outcrop along the way. Shortly before the top there is a mild scramble up a quartzite staircase which could be slippery if the rocks are wet. Once at the tiny cairn, there is a fine view over the eastern summits of Beinn Eighe. These are not classed as separate Munros but are fine summits linked by airy ridges including the notorious Black Carls pinnacles, and are well worth a days outing in their own right.\n\nReturn to the trig pillar and this time continue along the ridge to the west. The quartzite stones soon give way to a slabby sandstone crest that gives firmer going to a minor top before the stones return on the descent to a bealach at 820 metres.\n\nThe bealach and the climb beyond is uncharacteristically grassy and gentle, with great views back on the way up to the flat summit of Coinneach Mhor; in fact the top of the Triple Buttress, one of Scotland's finest cliffs, is only a short distance away to the west. From the cairn descend the steep and stony ridge to the narrow bealach which separates Ruadh-stac Mhòr from the main ridge of Beinn Eighe.\n\nThe first part of the climb up to Ruadh-stac Mhòr is very rocky and rough but soon becomes easier on a plateau before the final short pull up the summit scree-cone. Although not on the main ridge, this is the highest of Beinn Eighe's summits, and its detached position makes it a fabulous viewpoint for most of the range. Return to the bealach between the top and Coinneach Mhor. There is only one way down to the floor of Coire Mhic Fhearchair for non-climbers, and that is down the very steep and narrow scree gully heading northwest from here. Take great care on the descent, keeping to the right edge of the scree as the bedrock is exposed in places making a rocky staircase - though keep an eye out for loose rocks. The gully narrows at one point where it is almost blocked by a chockstone which is passed on the right.\n\nContinue down the right edge of the scree until below the broken cliffs, where a path continues the descent northwest between the scree and the bottom of the cliffs. Descend on this path until it too heads left down the lower section of scree; finally pick your way down the steep boulders to reach the flatter ground below. You are now below the screes but there is still some way to go before the easier terrain at the bottom of the corrie is reached. Head over to the left to pick up a path that continues the descent, staying fairly close to the bottom of the cliffs on the south side of the corrie. The path picks its way down several sandstone terraces and descends past some beautiful little pools and waterfalls to reach Lochan Coire Mhic Fhearchair.\n\nContinue on the path round the eastern shores of this beautiful lochan. Behind you is the magnificent Triple Buttress, seen to best effect when the far end of the lochan is reached. The exit stream from the lochan is a very popular spot for walkers coming up the path from Glen Torridon, with its classic view across the water to the masterpiece of rock architecture beyond. Cross the outflow from the loch to pick up an excellent stalkers path. This descends round the lower slopes of Sàil Mhòr - with views back of some attractive waterfalls below the loch outflow - contouring right round the base of the peak and offering fine views into the wild country behind Torridon. The path is rocky but very well constructed, and eventually leads to a large cairn at a junction with a path from Coire Mhic Nobuil. Keep left, on the main path, to descend Coire Dubh Mòr , and eventually return to the A896.",

    "description": "There is a large rough parking area off the south side of the A87 at Lundie (there are no buildings). These mountains are very foreshortened from here, only really appearing full height from much further down towards Glen Moriston. Start the walk by crossing the current A87 road and walking up an old section of the main road on the other side. After a short distance, turn left up a worn, stony track, signed for Càrn Ghluasaid. This follows the line of the old military road and heads up - with good views back - and through a gate before climbing to the right of a transmitter mast. Just beyond this it forks; the old military road contours the hillside, but our route follows the now more obvious hill path to the right, climbing the hillside.\n\nThis old stalkers path used for the ascent is a real delight, being well-graded and mostly dry underfoot. It climbs up to reach a flatter shoulder at An Cruachan, and later crosses some large rocky slabs across which the route is marked with rocks. Further on the path begins climbing again, tackling the steep slope on the left of Coire nan Clach in a series of sharp zigzags. Above this section the west ridge of Càrn Ghluasaid is joined and is enjoyable to follow. Eventually a flattish, bouldery plateau is reached.\n\nThere is a tiny cairn marking the highest point of Càrn Ghluasaid, but another cairn a few metres away has the finest position, situated on the northern edge of the plateau with steep cliffs falling immediately beyond. This rather insignificant summit is a Munro. Continue the walk, keeping the impressive cliffs of the corrie on your right. There is only a short descent before a longer climb leads up to the top of Creag a'Chaorainn; the path veers left to bypass the summit of this minor top.\n\nThere is a very slight descent to the very stony Creag Bealach before the ridge turns towards the north and climbs much more steeply towards the quite graceful summit dome of Sgùrr nan Conbhairean.\n\nThis massive Munro has a suitably large summit cairn and is one of the giants of the area at 1110 metres. It gives very extensive views, particularly impressive looking east over the corries. Go northwest for a short distance, still keeping the steeper cliffs on your right.\n\nFollow the now well defined ridge northwards, with grand views down to the crags and corries to the right, and the regenerating forest of Gleann na Cìche to the left. Once at the bealach, there is only short rise to the first and seemingly insignificant summit of Sàil Chaorainn; though a minor bump this is the third Munro of the day at 1002 metres, just a metre higher than the remoter north top. Return to the bealach below Sgùrr nan Conbhairean. It isn't necessary to climb all the way back over the summit; at the foot of the summit cone a small cairn marks a path which traverses below the summit to the west.\n\nDescend the southwest ridge, which is initially broad but soon narrows to a fine arête with the Gorm Lochan down to the left and Toll Easach to the right. The ridge rises ahead to Drochaid an Tuill Easaich; it isn't necessary to head right up to this summit as a path cuts across its left flank to gain its south ridge.\n\nHead along this ridge, making an initially excellent descent, with good views of Coire Làir on the left. Much lower down the ridge becomes indistinct around Meall Breac; descend southeast and then east down rough, tussocky and in places steep ground towards the Allt Coire nan Clach. If possible cross this burn above its ravine to pick up traces of a path down the east side.\n\nThe path improves as descent continues down to the line of old Military road, reached at a gate. A path ahead continues down to the busy main road ahead, but this can be avoided by instead turning left along the line of the old Military Road, now a faint path follow a line of old fenceposts. This climbs slightly and rejoins the outward route at the fork above the transmitter mast. Continue ahead to return to the start.",

    "summary": "The eastern neighbours of the Five Sisters are the three Munros Sgùrr a Bhealaich Dheirg, Sàileag and Aonach Meadhoin, often collectively known as the Brothers of Kintail. They give a very fine ridgewalk themselves, and are in no way overshadowed by their more famous siblings.",
    "description": "The starting point of the walk is the Glen Shiel car park (not layby) on the A87 east of a gap in the forestry, there is an information board about the Glen Shiel battle and a wooden Hill Path sign. Note that this is a one-way walk and you'll need to use public transport, bike, or a lift back up the road to return to this start point. Take the path west from the car park, soon turning right to follow a boggy path steeply up the slopes to the north keeping the forestry fence on your right. This first climb of the day is barely a kilometre long, but very steep as 550 metres have to be gained to reach the Bealach an Lapain.\n\nAt the corner of the forestry fence, turn left to head directly uphill on a fainter path marked with a tiny cairn. The route zigzags up the hillside above but never stops heading hard uphill until the Bealach na Lapain is reached with some relief. Turn right along the ridge.\n\nThe ridge has a well worn path and climbs very easily and directly to the summit cairn of Sàileag, at 956 metres. Sàileag feels fairly insignificant when compared with the other mountains on the ridge and given the short descent beyond the summit it is something of a surprise to find it is the first Munro of the day.\n\nContinue east along the ridge, descending just eighty metres or so to a col. Beyond there are a couple of minor summits to traverse before the start of a more prolonged climb up towards the next mountain.\n\nThis climb ends as the ridge levels off, turning southeast before the final gentle ascent to the summit ridge of Sgùrr a'Bhealaich Dheirg. There is a cairn at 1014 metres, but the actual summit of the mountain is a little further along the ridge. Continue along the ridge and then take the short arrete NE to reach the summit. Rocky, this short northeast ridge has drystone dyke built along it and a path on the east side. At 1038 metres, a fine cairn marks the true summit.\n\nRetrace your steps back to the main, broader ridge of the mountain before beginning a descent down the wide southeastern slopes, keeping the steeper slopes on your left, until the ridge becomes more distinctive once more as it turns east and drops again to the col at 827 metres. From the col, climb on a good path up to the 938 metre top, after which there is a small dip before the final climb to the summit of Munro number three, Aonach Meadhoin, at 1001 metres. From here, descend steeply at first before following a fine rocky ridge (bypass path on right in places) to the prominent top of Sgùrr an Fhuarail.\n\nMunro-baggers with plenty of energy may choose to descend the NNE ridge down to boggy Bealach a'Chòinich and to include Ciste Dhubh in the day, whilst others will be content and will descend the southeast ridge of Sgùrr an Fhuarail. The ridge descends simply at first, but it is necessary to traverse over a couple of minor summits to avoid the steep slopes on either side of the ridge.\n\nFrom the final bump at 843 metres, descend southwards, keeping the steepest ground to your left on the way down, before descending southeast to join the A87 opposite the Cluanie Inn. You are 7.5 kilometres from the start of the walk, so hopefully you've remembered to check the bus times or have arranged at lift!",

    "summary": "One of Scotland's best known hills, Schiehallion is one of the easiest Munros to climb on a fine summer's day. It takes the form of a broad ridge, with the famous conical appearance only apparent from across Loch Rannoch.",
    "description": "Park the Braes of Foss car park (charge). A memorial commemorates Schiehallion's part in a famous experiment. In 1774 the Astronomer Royal Maskelyne became the first to measure the mass of the earth, which he did by observing the deflection of a pendulum by the mass of Schiehallion. As part of the experiment the volume of Schiehallion had to be calculated, for which purpose contour lines were invented by Charles Hutton. The path to Schiehallion begins at the far end of the car park; at the junction in the woods, turn right to head through a gate, then follow a wall and cross a footbridge. At the next junction beyond, bear right on the main path.\n\nThe path runs through an area which has been planted with native oaks and will eventually regenerate as native woodland. Soon another gate is reached where this woodland is left behind. The path now passes some old tumbledown sheepfanks en route to the base of the east ridge.\n\nThe original path up Schiehallion ran from the car park directly up the flank of the mountain; it became a quagmire as well as a scar on the face of the hill, until this side of the hill was bought in 1999 by the John Muir Trust. The Trust is a conservation charity that protects wild places; they set about building the current path on a line that loops slightly further south, and the damage caused by the original route has been repaired. You can support the work of the trust by joining at http://www.johnmuirtrust.org/. The path has many stone steps and winds to and fro. As it climbs up onto and along the lower part of the ridge, excellent views open up, particularly looking across Loch Tummel towards Beinn a'Ghlò.\n\nOnce on the broad ridge, keep to the path which leads along the right edge of the ridge, passing a large cairn. From here the going becomes tougher, as quartzite boulders litter the ridge and make for awkward going. There are numerous cairns but the true summit of Schiehallion is further along the ridge than might be thought at first. Soon a higher section of ridge comes into view.\n\nClimb up onto this. Take care across the awkward boulders until the slightly pointed true summit, which is entirely covered with boulders and rock, is reached; there is barely a cairn but it cannot be mistaken in clear weather.\n\nThe views are extremely extensive - unsurprising given its central position and how often Schiehallion appears in the view from distant summits around Scotland. Most impressive is the view west across Rannoch Moor to the peaks of Glencoe. It is worth continuing over the rock slabs a few metres beyond the summit for the best views over Loch Rannoch.\n\nThe return to Braes of Foss is usually made the same way, taking full advantage of the path and preventing further erosion - do not short-cut down the old route.",

    "description": "There is a car park just north of the telephone box and house on the east side of the A835 just south of Inverlael Bridge. Start by going back out the car park entrance and then turning sharp right onto a track. This swings left near the house to head towards Inverlael Forest. Soon you enter the plantation. Ignore a track to the left and then one to the right, keeping on the track ahead which has a few waymarker posts. After 2km the track dips to cross a bridge; continue straight ahead on the far side. Eventually a ruined stone walled enclosure at Glensguaib is reached, and a track leads off to the left. Here any bikes should be left behind.\n\nTake the track to the left which soon swings right; fork off it here onto another track which heads steeply uphill. The main track along the glen floor is the route to the Beinn Dearg group. Soon a gate in the deer fence is reached and afterwards the path becomes a good stalker's path that continues to climb, with great views back towards An Teallach. As flatter ground is reached the path passes through an area of peat hags before reaching dry ground. The path eventually slopes down to and crosses the Allt Gleann a' Mhadaidh, which could be difficult in spate.\n\nKeep following the clear path on the far side. In poor weather this section can be very bleak but with good conditions the views can include the Fannichs and even distant Liathach and Beinn Eighe in Torridon. Once the burn has petered out the route continues ahead, climbing low over the northern slopes of Eididh nan Clach Geala before eventually crossing another burn just below a beautiful lochan - a tiny cairn on the far side marks the easiest spot where there are stepping stones.\n\nThe route now continues east up a high glen, passing above a series of pretty lochans, some with good spots for a wild camp, before climbing gently to peter out near small cairn on the flat and featureless watershed beyond. From here navigation can be very difficult in poor visibility. Continue ENE, descending a rough slope, avoiding a steep crag by keeping to the right of it. Once beyond this continue NE to reach the headwall above the impressive cliffs of Cadha Dearg. Continue around the rim until a path is picked up at the Gate of Ca'-derg, with great views back across the Cadha Dearg.\n\nThis heads uphill to the north, boggy in places, for the climb up onto the Seana Bhràigh plateau. It is worth crossing the 905m (OS 1:25k) / 906m (OS 1:50k) top in good conditions as the are superb views down into the dramatic Luchd Choire, the mountain's finest feature. Continue back from the cliff edge for the final climb to the summit, watching out for the wild goats that can sometimes be seen grazing on the higher ground. The top is marked by a windshelter cairn providing a good spot to take in the far reaching views, including the isolated peaks of Assynt to the north.\n\nThe impressive ridge seen enclosing the opposite side of the Luchd Choire leading up to Creag an Duine makes a fine and challenging scramble, approached from the walkers car park (outside stalking season only) at Corriemulzie Lodge in Strath Mulzie. There is also an easier approach to the hill from the same start point which reaches the summit from the north and can be used as a descent by scramblers. For those returning to Inverlael, however, the way back is by the same outward route. The very fit may opt to include Eididh nan Clach Geala or even Meall nan Ceapraichean on the long walk back.",

Follow the old road from the layby through a gate and then to the left parallel to the A9. After a short distance along the tarmac, fork right onto a track which slopes down to pass beneath the railway through a small tunnel. On the far side head right along a track, fording a small burn, and then keeping left to begin the walk up into Coire Dhomhain.\n\nThe steep dome-shaped hill on your left is the Sow of Atholl (a Corbett); unless including this in the day, continue along the track for 2km. Here is the first of two bridges over the main burn; there is a choice of routes to Sgàirneach Mhòr - our route crosses here, but it is possible to continue to a second bridge and initially follow a track up past some grouse butts. For our route, cross the first bridge, follow the first track around a bend to the left and then leave it for the start of a boggy path through the heather that aims up and across the slopes aiming for the bealach west of point 758m.\n\nCross the grassy gully below the bealach and continue the ascent towards Sgàirneach Mhor; as height is gained the ridge becomes well-defined with the broken crags of Coire Creagach on the right. At the apex above this corrie is the trig point marking the summit at 991 metres; the first Munro of the day. There is a first glimpse of Ben Alder but this view improves as the walk continues.\n\nThe descent begins very gently over perfect mossy turf. Head southwest at first, then northwest towards a bump before cutting down to the bealach at the head of Coire Dhomhain.\n\nFrom the bealach a path heads uphill beside a burn at first before curving to continue up the south ridge of Beinn Udlamain. The going becomes stonier and the walk generally follows a line of old metal fence posts (many of which are missing so not a completely reliable guide). There are magnificent views looking back of Ben Alder beyond Loch Ericht.\n\nCcontinue uphill, passing an old collapsed shelter, to eventually reach the huge cairn on the summit - at 1010 metres the highest of the Drumochter Munros.\n\nContinue northeast from the summit to a minor bump where the ridge then descends more steeply to the east. It is possible to continue the walk onto A' Mharconaich; otherwise continue almost to the 860m bealach before striking off steeply downhill over awkward heather. The descent is a bit of a trial - aim for the bottom of the stream flowing down from the bealach between Beinn Udlamain and A'Mharconaich - but keep well right of the stream as it has carved a ravine.\n\nThe floor of Coire Dhomhain will be reached with some relief.

    "description": "The walk begins from the A85 at the start of the driveway to Auchessan. There is parking for a couple of cars to park hard on the left near the start of the track taking care to leave plenty of space for farm vehicles to manoeuvre, or alternatively on the grass verge of the A85 itself. Begin by following the tarmac lane towards Auchessan, crossing a bridge over the River Dochart. Both Munros are visible from here, their summits just rising above the moor. Follow the track as it leads past a couple of houses and reaches the old farmhouse. In front of this go straight ahead (the path on the left is used for the return), passing through a gate and to the right of a large barn. After another couple of gates the track reaches the Allt Riobain. Do not cross this burn but instead leave the track and take the faint path which runs between the burn and a fence.\n\nThe burn soon swings left and the path climbs alongside it. The going can be muddy in places but the stream has many small waterfalls, attractively fringed by trees, and provides interest during the ascent. On the left the large fenced area has been planted with native trees and should eventually become a fine woodland, whilst there are good views back over Glen Dochart to mighty Ben More. Further on the path goes through a deer fence, and finally at the top corner of a plantation it begins to peter out.\n\nContinue above the Allt Robain, soon reaching a sleeper bridge over a tributary. Around 300m further upstream is a dam. Cross the Allt Robain - the easiest place is a little below the dam - and head up the far side to reach a track which services the dam. From here head directly for Sgiath Chuil to the northeast, crossing wet moorland at first and a steeper section on drier grass higher up. Once above the steepening ground, a prominent crag is seen ahead - the summit is atop this.\n\nThe crag itself can be passed equally easily to either side to reach the cairn, which provides some stunning views. Mighty Ben Lawers is prominent, as are Ben Vorlich and Stuc a'Chroin further right. From here a broad ridge leads northwards; follow this towards a slight bealach.\n\nReaching Meall Glas from here involves an extremely very steep descent to the west down to the Lairig a'Churain. Head north along the ridge at first, then use a path that aims across the west side of Meall a' Churain. Then descend the very steep slopes to the west. The going is mostly grassy - could be very slippery when wet - with some patches of stones. After the initial steepest section continue down to the boggy bealach, over 300m lower than Sgiath Chuil.\n\nOn the far side continue up initially boggy, more gradual slopes before an equally steep climb towards Beinn Cheathaich; you can either aim for the low point the ridge south of Beinn Cheathaich, passing through a band of broken crags at one point, or bypass the crags by aiming north of the summit. From the bealach south of Beinn Cheathaich a path leads towards the Munro summit of Meall Glas a little over a kilometre away.\n\nThe summit is marked by a small cairn. Ben Challum looks very impressive from here, dominating the view west. Begin the return walk to Auchessan by heading a little southeast to pass some broken crags.\n\nThe route then heads southwards, picking up a boggy path for a lengthy moorland traverse, eventually picking up a burn and following it as it descends east of Creag nan Uan. Go straight across a faint, very wet track and keep to the path on the left side of the burn for a time. Eventually the edge of the fenced woodland regeneration area is reached; follow this downhill to the right until reaching a stile in a dip. Cross the stile and continue on the now drier, grassy path which continues down through pleasant scattered woodland near the stream. Pass to the right of the sheepfolds to join a track, and follow this down to the back of the farmhouse at Auchessan. The track passes round the left side of this to regain the outward route; now turn right to head back to the start.",

It is also exceptionally remote and arduous; many will break the route with an overnight stay at Corrour bothy. This can be approached either from the Linn of Dee to the south leaving a very long return, or via the Chalamain Gap from the Sugar Bowl car park on Speyside - the latter route making the traverse possible in a single epic day for the extremely fit.",
    "description": "The most convenient start point is the Sugar Bowl car park on the left at the foot of the zig-zags on the Cairngorm ski road (long alternatives which avoid the Chalamain Gap include Whitewell and Loch Morlich). Cross the road and follow the path down to a footbridge over the Allt Mòr in a ravine. On the far side bear right uphill and then back left onto a paved path that keeps to the north of the stream for a couple of kilometres with good views before it dips to cross the now small stream once more. Beyond the path continues, climbing gradually towards the obvious little rocky pass ahead - the Chalamain Gap.\n\nBefore reaching this the path vanishes as the gap is floored by rough, awkward boulders. Progress through the gap is slow and care is needed - this is a potential leg-breaker. The terrain thankfully eases once more on the far side as the path slopes downhill to the south southwest towards the great cleft of the Lairig Ghru. Soon the path descends more steeply down to a burn, joining a path coming up from Rothiemurchus Forest. Turn left here and follow the path which soon crosses the burn at a rocky section.\n\nFollow the path up the glen into the remarkable deep trench of the Lairig Ghru, filled with hummocky morraines left behind by the ice-age. This is Scotland's most famous hill pass, climbing to almost three thousand feet between two of the highest mountains in the land. The great broken cliffs of Lurcher's Crag wall the left side at first, and soon the walls of Sròn na Lairig on the right become just as impressive. At the top of the pass, if the weather is clear, the summits of Cairn Toul and the Devil's Point come into view for the first time. The path is lost as the route continues over several stony morains, passing the Pools of Dee - one of the two sources of the mighty river that flows to Aberdeen. Keep to the left side of the stream on the descent, crossing the foot of the slopes of mighty Ben Macdui, as the branch to the right heads into the great super-corrie of An Garbh Coire.\n\nContinue following the path southwards, with terrific views into Garbh Choire on the right - the great rim of the cliffs far above is the route followed later in the walk. After almost four kilometres from the pools the Clach nan Taillear is reached. The name means the Stone of the Tailors and according to local legend it was behind this rock that a group of tailors died in a blizzard when crossing the Lairig as part of a wager. Follow the path for almost another kilometre before turning right onto a branch path that crosses a bridge over the river Dee to reach lonely Corrour bothy. Unless attempting to complete the walk in a single epic day, this open shelter - or a tent pitched at a good distance from it - is the most likely spot to spend the night. The bothy is maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting.\n\nFrom Corrour bothy, the great rocky boss of the Devil's Point looks formidable. To reach it, take the path that climbs up close by the Allt a 'Choire Odhair into the high corrie. The headwall is ascended by means of a zig-zag path - often blocked by hard snow well into the summer. The climb ends very suddenly as the route emerges onto the wide, spacious bealach beyond. The Devil's Point - so impressive from lower down the glen - is reached easily by a detour to the left from here, with less than a hundred metres of further ascent. Return to the bealach and begin the much longer climb up the wide, windswept slopes to the northwest, reaching the summit of Stob Coire an t-Saighdeir at the very edge of the steep corrie of the same name.\n\nContinue around the rim of the corrie, descending gently before a final steeper climb up a boulderfield to the summit ridge of Cairn Toul. This bouldery summit is the fourth highest in Britain - and the most remote of the four, with an elegant outline from many directions. The views are superb, especially northwest over the great gulf of Coire an Lochain with its fine lochan to the mighty summit of Braeriach. The route turns west here and descends over boulders, this time with the cliffs of Coire an Lochain falling vertically on the right.\n\nAfter crossing a bealach the route climbs again, now on easier terrain, to reach Sgòr an Lochain Uaine - also known as the Angel's Peak. A twin to Cairn Toul, Sgòr an Lochain Uaine was promoted to become a separate Munro in 1997. Its northeast ridge is a fine scramble but our traverse continues along the headwalls of the cliffs, descending to another bealach - with great views looking back - before climbing to Càrn na Criche above the great buttresses of Garbh Choire Mòr .\n\nAt this point the route flattens off into a truly vast plateau. Head east northeast, keeping away from the crags, to reach the second branch of the infant river Dee. Amazingly, at an altitude of 1200 metres, this is already a fast-flowing stream. Cross it and make a bee-line across the featureless plateau towards Braeriach. The summit of this mountain - the highest on the route - is on the very edge of the great gulf of Coire Bhrochain - with perhaps the finest crags on the walk plunging away at one's feet. For this reason it can be very dangerous to navigate towards the cairn in winter conditions in poor visibility - in which case a good distance should be kept from the plateau edge. The views are superb, both over the great forests of Speyside and back across all the corries of the Garbh Choire complex to Cairn Toul, and across the Lairig to Ben Macdui.\n\nContinue along the corrie edge before bearing left and descending to a bealach and then up onto the Sròn na Lairig ridge. Follow the path that descends northwards along this ridge, eventually passing close to the edge of the steep crags that plunge back down to the Lairig Ghru and across to Lurcher's Crag opposite. Continue on the path to the north until it descends to rejoin the Lairig path once the terrain becomes easier. Cross the stream once more and then follow the outward path when it branches right, climbing once more towards the Chalamain Gap. Pass through the gap - a sore trial on the boulders at the end of an epic route - and retrace your steps back to the Sugar Bowl car park.",

    "description": "Catch a train to Corrour Station. The remotest stop on the UK rail network, it isn't accessible by road. The large building here - once a hostel - is now a cafe / restaurant. Begin the walk along the vehicle track across the moor to the east. When the track forks, keep right, with the tiny Loch Ossian Youth Hostel visible at the shore of the loch. The hostel - which is a superb place to stay - can be visited by a short detour to the left at the next cross roads. Otherwise turn right at this crossroads and then left onto a newly repaired path.\n\nThis path was once part of the famous 'Road to the Isles' and, in this direction, leads eventually to Rannoch Station. It runs parallel to the track by Loch Ossian but at a higher level, and gradually gains more height, becoming very boggy as it crosses the flat ground east of Meall na Lice. It meets another path at a junction by Peter's Stone - a boulder with a plaque attached in memory of Peter Trowell. From here leave the paths behind and head directly up the open slope to the east up wet moorland to reach Meall na Letire Duibhe.\n\nFrom here follow the broad, bumpy shoulder around Coire Creagach to reach the handsome cairn that marks the summit of Càrn Dearg. Though it is lower than many of the mountains around, this is still a fine viewpoint. The start of the ridge which leads down to the Mam Ban is not immediately obvious, though the grassy cone of Sgòr Ghaibhre and its twin Top, Sgòr Choinnich, point the way on a clear day. There is a small intervening bump and one steeper section before the boggy bealach is reached.\n\nThe path from the Mam Ban up Sgòr Gaibhre is much clearer, and leads directly up to the summit; though the higher of the two Munros Sgòr Gaibhre has a much smaller cairn. The eastern side of the mountain is much steeper and craggier than the west, and the massive bulk of Ben Alder looms is this direction. Also easy to identify is Schiehallion - looking very fine and pointy from here.\n\nSome care is needed in poor visibility on the descent to the Bealach nan Sgòr as there is steep ground on the east side - be sure to head northwest initially. From the bealach almost equally steep slopes lead up to Sgòr Choinnich - a twin to Sgòr Gaibhre but only a Top. You can avoid the ascent to the summit of this by making a rising traverse to the left from the bealach. Either way, cross gentle slopes to cross Meall Nathrach Mòr , and continue down the pathless heather towards the foot of Loch Ossian. Keep to the right of the plantations; there is a gate in the fence across the slope beside a burn.\n\nCross boggy ground - keeping just right of a felled area - to reach a clear path, and turn left along this, crossing a bridge, to reach the head of Loch Ossian beside Corrour Lodge. Turn left along the track, crossing a bridge, to begin the walk back along the track to Corrour Station (or Loch Ossian SYHA). There are better views looking back to the lodge - a striking modern building which was completed in 2001 and replaced the original lodge which burnt down in 1942.\n\nKeep right at a fork to bypass the older estate buildings. The track leads through forestry - enlivened by rhododendron blooms in spring - with occasional breaks giving good views over Loch Ossian. Eventually the conifers give way to more natural birches and finally open ground before a junction is reached with the Loch Ossian SYHA over to the right.

    "summary": "Sgòr Gaoith gives a superb, fairly short hillwalk when approached from Glen Feshie. The ascent passes through some magnificent pinewoods before climbing the bare upper slopes to reach a vast plateau. The summit is extremely dramatic perched on the very edge of the vast broken crags that plunge down to Loch Einich; the views are superb.",
    "description": "Take the road up the east side of Glen Feshie (signed Achlean); just before the bridge over the Allt Ruadh turn left on a track; there is a parking area about fifty metres off the road. The walk begins by following this track to the east; it passes through a plantation at first, then giving way to birch trees and passing a large boulder.\n\nJust beyond here the track forks; the right branch heads down to cross the burn. The correct route is to take the left fork, a much improved ascending footpath. This excellent path climbs high above the steep cleft of the Allt Ruadh, clothed with magnificent mature pinewoods. As height is gained there are also fine views back over Badenoch to the rolling Munros of the Monadhliath.\n\nShortly before reaching the Allt nam Bo, the path forks again - this time ignore the left branch and stay on the main (right) path. This descends slightly to cross the burn. The route leaves the old pinewoods behind now but despite the removal of the fences the reduction in deer numbers has enabled regeneration to take place; there are young pines all along the path, with some beginning to grow much higher up the hillsides. Continue on the well built path, crossing the Allt Coire na Cloiche and then traversing for a long distance to reach the Allt a'Chrom Alltain.\n\nContinue by the burn briefly before before crossing it and ascending southeast up the open slopes. The well-made path is left behind now - the ascent here is badly eroded. The path narrows on the flat shoulder at around 810 metres; soon it bends right to ascend across the slope to the bealach between Sgòr Gaoith and Carn Bàn Mòr; one short section of path is very wet (this can be bypassed and shortcut by ascending ahead on pathless ground to rejoin the route on the plateau N of the bealach). The bealach is just a slight dip in a vast plateau that stretches for miles, south to the Munro of Mullach Clach a'Blair and then eastwards across the flat, high altitude bogs of the Moine Mhor. The route continues on a path leading NNE. It is worth heading over to the eastern edge of the plateau for the views along the crags on the approach to the sharply peaked summit of Sgòr Gaoith.\n\nThe summit of Sgòr Gaoith, a lofty 1118 metres, has a stunningly dramatic location. It is perched right on the edge of the huge sweep of broken crags, where the Feshie plateau plunges precipitously down to lonely Loch Einich. Across the far side is the huge bulk of Braeriach, its flanks scooped with a whole series of corries. In winter conditions great care is needed as the edge is usually heavily corniced; in anything less than perfect visibility it would be all too easy to fall through the snow and down the cliffs.\n\nMuch the easiest descent route is to retrace your steps. To vary the route, unless you've decided on a very long walk taking in Mullach Clach a'Bhlàir (in which case it is better to start the walk at Achlean and use the stalkers path to reach the plateau just south of Càrn Ban Mòr ), a good alternative descent is to head along the Meall Buidhe - Geal Chàrn ridge. Descend to the next wide bealach to the north; Sgoran Dubh Mòr, which was once a Munro itself. Now a Top, it can easily be included by a short detour from here. Otherwise descend the spongey slopes to the west, crossing or skirting around a minor bump (978 metres) to ascend Meall Buidhe beyond.\n\nThis is a little rockier than the main plateau, with one or two short sections over boulders; the cairn is at the far end. Continue across the next bealach, skirting another small knoll; to reach the col beyond there's a brief steep descent. Climb once more to Geal Chàrn. This was also once a Munro, at 920m, but like Sgoran Dubh Mòr was demoted to the status of a Top as the separation from Sgòr Gaoith was too slight. From Geal Chàrn's summit, continue in the same direction for about three hundred metres before turning sharp left and descending southwest down the open, largely pathless heathery slopes. The outward path is gained near the Allt Coire na Cloiche; turn right down it and retrace the outward route through the pinewoods to return to the start.",

    "summary": "Sgòr na h-Ulaidh is the forgotten Munro amongst the Glencoe peaks, being out of sight for most of the road through the glen. Combined with the Corbett Meall na Lighiche, it gives a day with superb views - but with a very steep ascent.",
    "description": "Park a few metres east of bridge over the Allt Gleann Leac na Muidhe, where there is a car park. Sgòr na h-Ulaidh is not in view from here; the ridge end of Aonach Dubh a Ghlinne is prominent and the more distant peak to its right is Meall Lighiche. To begin the walk, cross the bridge - carefully as traffic really speeds along here, before turning left on the track signed for Gleann Leac na Muidhe House. Follow the track uphill; after around a kilometre it crosses the stream via a bridge over a small gorge. There are great views of the Aonach Eagach over your left shoulder.\n\nThe track bends right as it passes a large modern house; a short distance further on bear left onto a signed footpath which bypasses the next properties and then rejoins the farm track just before the farm steading. Pass to the right of a barn and continue to a gate at the end of the plantation (cross the stile here to the right); the track ends just beyond. Follow the path which soon comes close to the river. If including Meall Lighiche in the itinerary, you now need to cross it; this is easy enough as long as it isn't in spate just a short distance along where there is an island in the middle. Once across there is a short stretch of boggy ground to cross as you head climb uphill, heading round to the right slightly to gain the start of the steep ridge leading up to Creag Bhan. Continuing up this ridge, there is soon a rocky knobble which appears to block the route; head to the right of this until a grassy gully enables you to climb back onto the ridge. Ascend the steep slopes above, with great views to admire behind as you catch your breath.\n\nThe slope eases as Creag Bhan is reached, and further on a line of fenceposts is reached at an angle in the ridge. The summit of Meall Lighiche is reached by a fairly short detour from here, turning right and following a path close to the line of fenceposts. The summit cairn, a Corbett at 772 metres, has a terrific all-round view, particularly down Glen Creran to the sea, whilst northwest the twin peaks of Beinn a'Bheithir look magnificent. Return to the point where you met the fenceposts, and this time follow them southeast as they make the descent to Bealach Easan. This descent is steep with a few low tiers of crags to negotiate, but is simple enough compared to the climb the other side, so on the descent have a good look at the slopes leading up to Corr na Beinn opposite to try to pick out the best line. At the bealach there is a gate in the line of fenceposts.\n\nOn the far side of the bealach the fenceposts climb up directly to the base of high crags, so instead make a rising ascent to the right, a little west of south, to gain the long grassy north-west shoulder of Corr na Beinn you might have picked out on the descent. Continue up this shoulder on very steep grass. Higher up the route heads slightly to the right to ascend a weakness in a rocky band, reaching another grassy slope beyond with a big drop on the right and some crags on the west side of Corr na Beinn ahead. Climb back left here as soon as you can; the gradient begins to ease and the final ascent to Corr na Beinn can be made directly. The ridge will be gained with some relief and not just for the views towards Mull; this ascent route is not suitable for descent as the lines of crags are hard to see from above. Follow the grassy ridge eastwards on a path which then climbs steeply for a short distance and traverses a false summit before reaching the true cairn at last.\n\nThe cairn at the Munro summit of Sgòr na h-Ulaidh is perched on the edge of the northern crags at 994 metres and is a marvellous viewpoint, with Loch Etive and Ben Starav prominent to the south and Ben Nevis rising proudly to the north over scores of lower peaks. The summit itself is riven by a great gully heading down the crags; round the top of this before following the path eastwards for a short distance where it begins the steep descent of the northeast ridge. The upper section of this is very rocky but the zig-zag path eases the going; the ascent to the top of Stob an Fhuarain beyond is more gentle. From this top, descend northwards to the 798 metre bealach on the Aonach Dubh a Ghlinne ridge.\n\nFrom the bealach head directly downhill into Gleann Leac na Muidhe; there is some scree higher up and steep grass lower down where it is possible to cross the stream in several places to find the easiest going. Close to the bottom, the stalkers' path down the glen is joined. Turn right along this, which soon comes alongside the picturesque stream. After just over a kilometre, the outward route is joined where you crossed the river in the morning. Continue straight ahead to the gate to rejoin the track that leads eventually back to the A82.",

This village, famous for centuries of slate quarrying, enjoys a spectacular location by Loch Leven at the foot of Glen Coe. It is dominated by the eastern summit of Beinn a'Bheithir, Sgòrr Bhan, with the route of ascent - Schoolhouse Ridge - in clear view. Begin the walk by following the road from the toilets into the village, keeping straight ahead when the main road bends right next to the pub. Follow the road to the river and cross over this before turning immediately left onto a lane past the school. If you wish to avoid the Schoolhouse Ridge scramble, you can turn right just after the school and follow a boggy track and then an arduous, ever steepening and sometimes pathless slog up the slopes of Beinn Bhan, before rejoining the route we describe at Sgòrr Bhan.\n\nOur route, however, continues along the main track up the glen until it passes through a gate after 750m. Very shortly after this turn right up a path aiming towards Schoolhouse ridge, which looks quite intimidating from below. The path climbs directly towards the ridge, and is steep and direct. The views back over Ballachulish improve all the time, and eventually the going becomes rockier. The first rocky wall, several metres in height, can be climbed straight ahead on good holds, or there's a slightly easier line a few metres to the right. Shortly afterwards is a second, steeper wall, again with good holds; this time there's an obvious easier route to the left up a rocky groove.\n\nAbove this the going eases, and there's a final less steep rocky section, and then a steady pull towards Sgòrr Bhan, where the route avoiding the scramble rejoins that described here. Sgòrr Bhan is a fine viewpoint marked with a small cairn, but most eyes will be drawn along the gracefully curving ridge that descends slightly before climbing up towards Sgòrr Dhearg.\n\nSgòrr Dhearg is the highest of Beinn a'Bheithir's summits at 1024m and is the first Munro of the day. There are few remains of the trig point marked on maps as being at the summit apart from a couple of iron rods sticking out of the cairn. The views are fabulous in all directions, with the great trough of Glen Coe prominent, framed by the curving ridge just traversed.\n\nThere's a fine prospect along the ridge to come to Sgòrr Dhònuill. Perhaps the finest best is that of Loch Leven and the Mamores backed by Ben Nevis. Descend the stony ridge WSW which leads gradually down to the bealach, where there are some old iron fence posts, at 760 metres. Begin the climb on the path up the far side.\n\nThe first section is up a grassy slope but after a brief gentle section it becomes increasingly rocky. The final ascent looks like an intimidating cone but involves only a very little simple scrambling, though the path is exposed at one point. The summit of Sgòrr Dhònuill is 1001m and is surprisingly spacious after looking so small on the ascent.\n\nIt is an even finer viewpoint than Sgòrr Dhearg, with a magnificent vista over outer Loch Linnhe towards the islands of Lismore and Mull; keen eyes can pick out Scarba and even the Paps of Jura further to the south, best seen by detouring a short distance further along the ridge. After enjoying the views, return carefully down the ridge you came up, returning to the bealach.\n\nFrom the bealach a path begins the descent to the north. It is boggy in places but avoids the crags and keeps fairly close to a line of old fence posts. Eventually a flat, wet and grassy area is reached; the worn route switches to the right side of the fence just after this. The path here is very boggy, but continues beside the fence for some time. After passing another fenceline the path improves, and climbs slightly for a time, with some stone steps. The path becomes very clear and traverses the hillside, eventually passing through a felled area and then forestry plantations. Finally it descends more steeply to reach a forest road.\n\nGo straight across onto the path that continues opposite. Continue down the path to reach another wide forest track. This time ignore the path ahead (this heads to Glenachulish forest car park), and turn right along the track. It climbs very slightly before beginning a very steady descent; ignore the track coming in from the left. There are beautiful views over Loch Leven further along the track, and after rounding a bend, there's a view to the Pap of Glencoe. Ignore the turnings to the right and emerge on the A82 just west of St John's Church. Turn right along the road (there is a pavement) to return to Ballachulish.

The route is a grade 2/3 scramble, and is included in some climbing guides as a 'Moderate' rock climb; it involves probably the trickiest scrambling on any Walkhighlands route. Ensure you have the necessary skills and experience, choose a dry day (the rocks are slippery when wet) and leave plenty of time to complete the route in daylight. If in any doubt, it is best to hire a guide.",
    "description": "Park at the small parking area on the north side of the A82 about three hundred metres west of the solitary house at Allt-na-reigh. This car park is often full, in which case there is a larger car park a short distance further west along the road. The view of the Aonach Eagach is rather foreshortened from here; in the photograph opposite it is shown from Loch Achtriochtan further down the glen. The path is initially a little eroded but soon joins a section which has been repaired. There are two options for the route up Am Bodach, heading either directly and very steeply up the spur to the summit, or alternatively heading further right to come alongside the Allt Ruigh.\n\nTe more direct path involves several sections of scrambling, en route to the first Top, Am Bodach. This is an excellent viewpoint, with the first hint of the drama to come in the view of a rock pinnacle known as 'The Chancellor' below (luckily our route does not visit this pinnacle!).\n\nThe first real scrambling comes on the descent from Am Bodach. A short distance from the summit there is an awkward, sloping, slabby cliff to descend; it is steep but not excessively so, but there is a large drop from the ridge below it, and it can become very slippery in the wet. Once safely down this descent, the ridge is narrow with a few short scrambly sections but fairly straightforward with a good path as it continues onto Meall Dearg. This is the first Munro of the day, at 953 metres, and is famous as being the final Munro climbed by the Reverend A.E. Robertson, who became the first man to complete the Munros here in 1901. He kissed first the cairn, and then his wife. Meall Dearg is a good viewpoint for the other Glencoe peaks, but all walkers eyes will be drawn to the ridge ahead - a frightening prospect for many!\n\nThe ridge has several steep rocky chimneys and other scrambling sections which must be climbed and descended, and is very exposed in several places (though it is not as consistently narrow as reputation would have it). There are many short scrambles necessary all along this ridge; the trickiest section is known as the 'Crazy Pinnacles' and is well along the ridge. There is a particularly tricky move right at the end - a very steep descent onto a narrow section of ridge, which must be climbed down facing the rock. The difficulties then end when the Munro 'Top' of Stob Coire Lèith is reached. Note that there are no safe descents from the Aonach Eagach once embarked on this section of ridge; there have been many accidents to scramblers attempting to leave the ridge before the end of the scrambling. The only possible escape route (if time is short) is descend northwards from Meall Dearg (incidentally this route gives an easy ascent to Meall Dearg for baggers who do not wish to traverse the ridge).\n\nFrom Stob Coire Lèith the ridge continues easily with a broad path to the second Munro, Sgòrr nam Fiannaidh, the highest on the ridge at 967 metres; it has a superb view of the lower reaches of Glen Coe. All that remains is the descent from the ridge. Do not attempt the descent along the rim of Clachaig Gully, which has an extremely eroded and very dangerous 'path', the scene of several fatalities (as well as the danger of sending stones down which could endanger the lives of others). It is sometimes recommended to descend instead southwards from the summit to Loch Achtriochtan; however this is a very steep descent with much scree and is also probably best avoided.\n\nInstead head west along the ridge. A large cairn is passed at a slight dip - ignore the path off to the left here which leads towards the Clachaig Gully and instead continue along the ridge for a short distance. Before the ridge climbs slightly to two small cairns, bear slightly right to pick up an initially indistinct path, with a stunning view ahead over the Ballachulish narrows. This stony path eventually becomes clearer and works its way down the broad slope that links the ridge with the Pap of Glencoe. The path leaves the ridge before the bealach, bearing left to join the Pap of Glencoe path further down the flank.\n\nFinally turn left down this path, soon swinging sharply back right and, after a further descent, crossing the Allt a'Mhuillin burn. On the far side follow the path to a track and then turn left to head down to the Glencoe - Clachaig road about a kilometre east of Glencoe village. If you haven't arranged transport, you have a long walk back up the glen to return to your parked car - not included in the times or distances given.",

Either way, if in a car, park at the layby on the A890 opposite the telephone box and the private road to Achnashellach station. From here walk up the road to the station, turning right after the outbuildings. Cross the railway line with care and proceed up the track a short way until you reach a crossroads. Here turn left slightly back on yourself and continue on a forestry track, passing through a gate and into thinning trees. Ahead there is a good view of the prow of Fuar Tholl which at 907 metres just misses out on Munro status. The ascent of Fuar Tholl can easily be added to this route.\n\nAfter a short distance take a path to the left marked with a sign. The path heads towards the River Làir, passing through a gate with an ingenious dog stile, and through a mixture of gorse, broom, birch and single pine trees. The path begins to climb revealing fine views and passing the Achnashellach Estate deer stalking information sign. The stalking season here is 15 September to 20 October during which walkers should keep to the paths or phone the estate for further information.\n\nFollow the stony path as it winds uphill, ignoring a smaller path to the left. The ground becomes much barer as the path climbs above the last of the pines. After the gradient eases off, a path junction marked with a cairn is reached. There is a good view Sgòrr Ruadh and its majestic sandstone cliffs on the left side of the valley ahead, whilst the long scree-flanked ridge of Beinn Liath Mhòr guards the right side of the valley. Take the left fork. The path heads down to the River Làir which must be crossed; there is no bridge, and the crossing may not be possible if the river is in spate. Beyond, the path climbs gently at first, passing just left of a minor knoll, before steepening as it ascends towards the bealach between Fuar Tholl and Sgòrr Ruadh.\n\nThere are magnificent views on the left of the great Mainnrichean Buttress of Fuar Tholl. Continue climbing to the wide bealach where the are many tiny lochans. At this point, the route to Fuar Tholl goes off to the left. The route to Sgòrr Ruadh however heads just west of north across a complex rocky moonscape of low crags and lochans requiring careful navigation. Aim to the right of the largest of the lochans, Loch a Bhealaich Mhor. Beyond here the route steepens considerably. Climb north, trending very slightly E of N, until a grassy rake is reached that leads more easily northwest.\n\nThe slope eases as the broad summit ridge is reached, with stunning views northwards into Coire Làir. Head up the final cone of grass and boulders to reach the summit windshelter cairn - which almost blocks the ridge. Sgòrr Ruadh, like all the peaks in the Coulin Forest, it is a magnificent viewpoint, with shapely, individual and cliff-girt mountains in all directions; the view out to Torridon is particularly impressive.\n\nThe easiest return is to retrace your steps, but to make a circuit it is possible to descend via the northwest ridge. Follow this from the cairn - there is a path - soon heading down a short easy scrambling section. The path then diverts to the west flank of the ridge to avoid the rocky crest before rejoining it down a slope of quartzite boulders. Continue along the ridge until a tiny cairn WSW of the bealach marked on OS maps; there are great views back to Sgòrr Ruadh from here.\n\nFrom the cairn a narrow path descends steeply down mostly grassy slopes to the lochan at the bealach. Some hillwalkers opt to make a much longer day by continuing from here with a traverse of Beinn Liath Mhor, but our route turns right to follow the excellent stalkers path down through Coire Làir. This eventually rejoins the outward route near a prominent cairn above the ford crossed earlier; from here retrace your steps back to the start.",

Take the path west from the car park, soon turning right to follow a boggy path steeply up the slopes to the north keeping the forestry fence on your right. This first climb of the day is barely a kilometre long, but very steep as 550 metres have to be gained to reach the Bealach an Lapain.\n\nAt the corner of the forestry fence, turn left to head directly uphill on a fainter path marked with a tiny cairn. The route zigzags up the hillside above but never stops heading hard uphill until the Bealach na Lapain is reached with some relief. Turn right along the ridge.\n\nThe ridge has a well worn path and climbs very easily and directly to the summit cairn of Sàileag, at 956 metres. Sàileag feels fairly insignificant when compared with the other mountains on the ridge and given the short descent beyond the summit it is something of a surprise to find it is the first Munro of the day.\n\nContinue east along the ridge, descending just eighty metres or so to a col. Beyond there are a couple of minor summits to traverse before the start of a more prolonged climb up towards the next mountain.\n\nThis climb ends as the ridge levels off, turning southeast before the final gentle ascent to the summit ridge of Sgùrr a'Bhealaich Dheirg. There is a cairn at 1014 metres, but the actual summit of the mountain is a little further along the ridge. Continue along the ridge and then take the short arrete NE to reach the summit. Rocky, this short northeast ridge has drystone dyke built along it and a path on the east side. At 1038 metres, a fine cairn marks the true summit.\n\nRetrace your steps back to the main, broader ridge of the mountain before beginning a descent down the wide southeastern slopes, keeping the steeper slopes on your left, until the ridge becomes more distinctive once more as it turns east and drops again to the col at 827 metres. From the col, climb on a good path up to the 938 metre top, after which there is a small dip before the final climb to the summit of Munro number three, Aonach Meadhoin, at 1001 metres. From here, descend steeply at first before following a fine rocky ridge (bypass path on right in places) to the prominent top of Sgùrr an Fhuarail.\n\nMunro-baggers with plenty of energy may choose to descend the NNE ridge down to boggy Bealach a'Chòinich and to include Ciste Dhubh in the day, whilst others will be content and will descend the southeast ridge of Sgùrr an Fhuarail. The ridge descends simply at first, but it is necessary to traverse over a couple of minor summits to avoid the steep slopes on either side of the ridge.\n\nFrom the final bump at 843 metres, descend southwards, keeping the steepest ground to your left on the way down, before descending southeast to join the A87 opposite the Cluanie Inn. You are 7.5 kilometres from the start of the walk, so hopefully you've remembered to check the bus times or have arranged at lift!",

    "description": "Park at Achnashellach Forest car park, which is signed on the north side of the road at Craig. Walk back down cross the road and take the track opposite over the railway level crossing. The track bends left and heads up the glen. There are great views ahead of Sgùrr nan Ceannaichean. After about a kilometre the track bends right and crosses a bridge over the River Carron. Once across the river the track soon forks; take the left fork, which begins a long climb above the (unseen) Sloc Mòr gorge.\n\nAs height is gained, a terrific view opens up behind of the Coulin peaks. First to appear is Fuar Tholl on the left, later joined by Sgùrr Ruadh and Beinn Liath Mhor. After just over a kilometre another forestry track goes off to the right - ignore this and keep to the main track, with views ahead of the Allt a Chonais gorge. Further on another track goes off right, this time signed for the 'Allt a'Chonais pinewood'; again continue ahead, and ignore the forestry track on the left. The track passes through a gate in a deer fence before reaching the top of a pass just to the left of a knoll. Sgùrr Chòinnich and Sgùrr a'Chaorachain can now be seen ahead at the far end of the flat, treeless valley. Continue on the track, now slightly downhill, ignore a track leading to a small hydro dam. The track soon runs close to the river passing a wire bridge.\n\nIgnore a faint path on the right destined for Sgùrr na Feartaig, instead continuing until the track bends left and climbs. You can see the path the route is aiming for, smaking up the hill ahead slightly to the right in the distance. A small cairn marks where a stalkers path turns off here on the right, take this turning, which in a short distance leads down to the Allt a'Chonais. The burn is usually easily crossed in normal water conditions - or there is a new wire bridge around 20-30m upstream.\n\nThe first part of the stalkers path uphill has been widened to a track creating a scar on this part of the landscape. However it soon narrows back to a path which ascends the west side of the glen of the Allt Leathad an Tobair, with good views of Sgùrr Chòinnich. It keeps high above the stream, to reach the wide Bealach Bhearnais.\n\nBear left as the path continues to climb up to the second, higher bealach where there is a short section of old wall. Turn left to begin the ascent of the Streangan nan Aon Pacan-deug ridge. This is broad at first but narrows and becomes more defined as height is gained. It is mostly grassy but has three rocky bands to negotiate, all are easy with rock steps.\n\nThe ridge leads directly up to the narrow summit ridge, with the small summit cairn right on the edge of the crags. The summit ridge is straight and level apart from a brief dip and has a good view over the void of Pollan Buidhe. The summit cairn is a tantalising 999 metres high.\n\nFrom here, continue to the far end of the summit ridge and then descend the rocky ridge to the Bealach Coire Chòinnich. The path is eroded in places and there are views down to Loch Monar on the right. The ascent on the far side of the bealach is straightforward, rocky in a couple of places, leads to the large shelter cairn on the summit of Sgùrr a'Chaorachain. This is the higher of the two Munros at 1053 metres and on a clear day there are good views to the main Torridon summits to the north.\n\nUnless returning the same way or continuing to Maoile Lunndaidh, head north from the summit, down a grassy ridge for about 700 metres before bearing left (northwest) down the relentlessly steep slope that is boggy in places – the reward being the views of Sgùrr Chòinnich to the left.\n\nThere's a great aerial view of the long walk back too. As the gradient eases aim directly north to eventually cross the Allt a'Chonais to regain the track before heading back down the glen.",

    "description": "The road up Glen Strathfarrar is private and vehicular access is strictly controlled at the locked gate at Milton Cottage near Struy and a maximum number of 25 cars allowed in a day. In the summer months the gate is open from 9am to between 6 - 8pm depending on the month; it is closed all day Tuesday and until 1.30pm on Wednesdays. In the winter access must be arranged in advance through Mountaineering Scotland. See their page on Strathfarrar access for further details. There are no access restrictions for walkers or cyclists and there is a car park near Milton Cottage. To start this walk, drive along the Glen until a flat grassy area between Loch Beannacharan and Loch a' Mhuillidh is reached. Here a track heads north and there is parking on the grass just off the track. Follow the track uphill.\n\nContinue on the track past the small dam on the stream and continue uphill. Where a small path branches off to the left, continue for a very short while on the faint track and follow a clearer path to the left - they both eventually join up as they follow the Allt Coire Mhuillidh upstream. At this point the second Munro of the day, Càrn nan Gobhar can be seen straight ahead, a rather insignificant looking grassy dome, and the first summit, Sgùrr na Ruaidhe, slightly to the right looks very easy, but much of the ascent cannot be seen from this angle. After crossing the first side stream, climb up the easy grassy slope in a north east direction - there is a faint path but at times this is indistinct and boggy.\n\nBefore you reach the top, a stone shelter is reached and then the summit cairn a little further on at 993m. The walk to the Bealach nam Botaichean in a north, west north direction is on lovely spongy moss and grass which is very easy going. There is a small steep section to the actual col and then a long and straightforward pull up first north north west and then as the steepness eases, westwards, to the summit of Càrn nan Gobhar. The last few metres are covered in boulders and there is a small cairn at the north edge at 992 metres where there is a good view of the route up Sgùrr a'Choire Ghlais.\n\nFrom the cairn, retrace your steps along the ridge south over the boulders a short way and then follow the pleasant grassy ridge southwards and then south west as it steepens to Bealach Sneachda at 865m. The steep pull up the other side is straightforward with a small path and a boulder section near the top. There is are two large cairns on the summit (1083m) and a trig point in between. There are good views north to Glen Orrin, Strathconon and to the Fannichs beyond. From the northern cairn, you can descend the rocky ridge or bypass the boulders by heading west from the trig point and then heading back north to the ridge to continue north west along the clear ridge.\n\nThe descent to Bealach Toll Sgaile is straightforward and as the ridge narrows and the views of Creag Ghorm a'Bhealaich improve makes an impressive section of the walk. On the ascent the summit of Creag Ghorm a'Bhealaich can be bypassed but the tiny detour to the top is worth it for the dramatic views down into the coire. From here there is only a small descent before the final pull to the summit of Sgùrr Fhuar-thuill at 1049m.\n\nFrom the summit continue west, just beyond the col at 987m a stalkers path leaves the ridge to the south west - a small cairn marks the spot. From here there are great views across to the slabby face of Sgùrr na Muice with Loch Toll a' Mhuic below. Follow the clear path as it descends steeply at first and then traverses below the ridge and descends to the eastern side of the Loch. Keep following the path until it crosses the stream and later becomes a track and follows the course of the Allt Toll a' Mhuic downhill with some impressive waterfalls and pleasant birchwoods. Eventually the track emerges onto the Glen Strathfarrar road. Turn left here and follow the road for the 6km to return to the start, passing Braulen Lodge on the way.",

The walk starts on the excellent constructed path up the south side of the stream. The initial section passes a whole series of waterfalls as the stream tumbles down a small gorge. At several points paths head off to the right, but instead keep on the main path beside the stream. After two kilometres the well-constructed section of path ends and the route becomes more eroded. A short distance beyond, it crosses the stream either just below or just above an impressive waterslide - it doesn't matter which.\n\nContinue up the far bank of the stream on a wide eroded slope. Coire a Ghreadaidh looks spectacular from here, with a great gorge issuing out from the upper corrie. The only routes up onto the ridge from Coire a Ghreadaidh are rock-climbs; our route follows the path beside a branch stream heading to the left, leading towards the higher corrie to the left of Coire a Ghreadaidh, Coire An Dorus. After a steep climb beside the stream, continue up the left bank until reaching the floor of Coire An Dorus.\n\nThere's a great view of Sgùrr a Mhadaidh and Sgùrr a Ghreadaidh ahead, with a steep chute leading up to An Dorus ('The Door'), the lowest point on the ridge between the two peaks. Pass through a dry gorge to find the start of a path which zig-zags up the steep scree towards An Dorus. Do not head for the higher, even narrower col on the ridge further right, which is the Eag Dubh ('Black Cleft').\n\nThe gully narrows part way up, and then narrows again dramatically just a short distance from the top. From here to the top of An Dorus the floor of the gully is made of slabby rocks and involves some scrambling. From the top, the route to Sgùrr a Mhadaidh is very steep and awkward initially, but the scrambling soon becomes easier. This steep and awkward section can be avoided if needed by leaving the An Dorus gully a little lower down, just below the final narrowing. From here, a faint path slants easily upwards to the left (a full ninety degrees left from the line of the gully). The path continues in the same direction for a hundred and fifty metres, until it rounds a corner and the ridge leading from Sgùrr Thuilm up to Sgùrr a Mhadaidh comes into view across a wide bowl. From here, scramble very easily up to the right to reach a wide and easy scree slope. A cairn visible way over to the right is at the top of the hard section from An Dorus; you don't need to head right across to it, as the route from there continues up the scree on the left of the ridge until it is possible to scramble upwards to the crest of the ridge quite easily. The route onwards to the summit now keeps fairly close to the ridge crest, keeping to the left side to avoid any real difficulties.\n\nThe tiny cairn at the summit of Sgùrr a Mhadaidh (Peak of the Fox, 918m) is soon reached. This is the only one of the four summits of this mountain to attain Munro status - a good thing for walking Munro-baggers as continuing to the other tops involves Difficult rock-climbing. The view is superb, from Sgùrr Thuilm far below, taking in Sgùrr nan Gillean at the north end of the ridge, and the great gulf of Loch Coruisk far below to the huddle of sharp serrated peaks around Sgùrr Alasdair and the Inn Pinn. Most walkers attention will be fixed on the ridge up to Sgùrr a Ghreadaidh, which looks intimidating from here. Return back down to the An Dorus gully, either directly to its head or using the variant already described (the variant could be harder to find in descent).\n\nTo climb Sgùrr a Ghreadaidh, the wall on the south side of the An Dorus gap is climbed - a steep, stiff scramble - bear in mind that you will also need to be able to descend this way. A rope may be required, particularly if the rock is wet. Above this section, the scrambling is more straightforward - and much easier than it appeared from Sgùrr a Mhadaidh. The impressive gash of the Eag Dubh is passed fairly easily by descending slightly to the left. The next obstacle is a great boss of rock known as the Wart, but this can be avoided to the right on slabby rocks. Beyond, the summit is soon reached. Sgùrr a Ghreadaidh (973m) is the highest peak on the northern half of the Cuillin Ridge. From most directions its twin summits have a gentle dome outline - an illusion that is shattered on reaching the north (Munro) peak. The section of ridge which continues to the slightly lower south peak is perhaps the narrowest arête in the whole of the British Isles, and sensationally exposed. The return route is back down the ridge to An Dorus, and then down to the path up the corries below.The grade and times given assume that this option is taken.\n\nExtremely keen and experienced scramblers (only) can continue traversing the ridge. Taking this route is very committing, as there are no practical descent routes until Sgùrr na Banachdich is reached, a whole kilometre of sustained scrambling further on. There is nothing more difficult than the climb out of An Dorus, but there is a lot of exposure. This route starts by making the airy traverse to Sgùrr a Ghreadaidh's south summit - the easiest way is to keep slightly to the right of the true ridge line, but whatever route is taken has great exposure. Beyond, the scrambling continues down to a dip in the ridge, before ascending again towards a group of pinnacles known as the Three Teeth - these can be easily avoided to the left. The next peak, Sgùrr Thormaid (Norman's Peak, named after Norman Collie, one of the great pioneers of climbing in the Cuillin) looks intimidating. Its ascent is directly up the edge of the slab.

    "description": "Park at the car park at the very end of the road up Glen Nevis. There is a tremendous water slide descending from Ben Nevis here. Follow the main path up the glen into predominantly deciduous woodland. The path is very popular but the surface is rocky in places. After a few hundred metres the glen curves to the right and narrows, with the cliffs across the river giving some of the feel of an Alpine gorge. The path continues up the glen and soon emerges from the trees. The section of the more open glen ahead makes a tremendous view, with the green pastures of the valley floor surrounded by fine woodland backed by great mountains - with as centrepiece the great Steall Falls, a tremendous waterfall where a stream cascades four hundred feet down a broken cliff into the glen.\n\nBear right off the main path onto a smaller one heading for the steel-cable bridge. This consists of three cables - two for handrails, and one on which you can balance your boots. The brave will edge across it, high over the river, whilst the more circumspect will paddle across the shallows just upstream (impossible in spate conditions). Once across, turn left and pass the Steall Hut (private) and continue into the woods to cross the burn on the rocks at the very base of the Steall falls. If in spate, this may be easier on the flats just downstream.\n\nContinue around the base of the next buttress on extremely boggy ground. Once beyond this take the stalkers' path heading uphill. It soon reaches a section where a landslip has destroyed the old path - continue up steeply beside this. There are great views back over the Steall Meadows. Further up the path improves, eventually traversing right across the corrie, whereupon it continues uphill in a series of zigzags until heading to the right onto the shoulder of a grassy ridge.\n\nFollow the path that climbs steeply southeast up this ridge. Above the steep section the ascent finally relents a little along a straightforward grassy section before the final pull up to the summit of An Gearanach. This is the first Munro of the day, at 982 metres, and has tremendous views both back to Ben Nevis and across to Sgùrr a' Mhaim.\n\nFrom here, continue along the ridge which narrows to the dramatic, rocky arête of An Garbhanach. The traverse of this 'Top' is an airy but fairly straightforward but exposed scramble, reminiscent but a little harder than the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arete. The scrambling continues as the ridge heads down to the next bealach. Continue by climbing up to Stob Coire a' Chàirn; the scrambling is over for now but the ridge steepens with some scree towards the top. The cairn is at 981 metres and is the second Munro of the day; there are great views, particularly of the Grey Corries and eastern Mamores. Descend the much easier, grassy southwest ridge, traversing over a minor summit, before beginning the steep climb up to Am Bodach. This is rocky and a little loose, so care is needed with the mild scrambling on the ascent. Am Bodach (The Old Man) is 1032m high - the third Munro of the day.\n\nDescend the easier west ridge which drops down to another bealach before a straightforward climb up to Sgùrr an Iubhair. At 1001 metres, this was briefly a Munro between 1981 and 1997, a promotion and relegation in status that only the Scottish Mountaineering Club could explain! The route now turns north away from the main spine of the Mamores, following instead what has been named 'The Devil's Ridge'. It begins easily enough as it descends NNW to a wide bealach, before beginning the traverse of the 'Top' of Stob Coire a' Mhail. This is an excitingly exposed and narrow arete, mainly grassy with a path along the crest.\n\nOn the descent from the Top, there is one trickier section of ridge composed of shattered rocks. It can be scrambled over, but most walkers avoid it by taking a bypass path which descends a little on the left, climbing back to the ridge just beyond. A short distance further the descent of a rock step is the final minor obstacle - this is most easily climbed down by starting on the right and descending it diagonally towards the left. Beyond, the ridge continues easily to Sgùrr a' Mhaim, the latter section being on the quartzite stones that give this mountain the appearance of being snow covered. There are great views back along the Devil's Ridge.\n\nSgùrr a' Mhaim is the fourth and final Munro of the day, and its position away from the main ridge makes it a magnificent viewpoint; Stob Ban looks especially fine to the southwest. Do not be tempted to descend the northeast ridge towards Steall, as there is difficult and dangerous steep ground much lower down which has been the scene of fatal accidents. Instead, take the easier northwest ridge, down shattered quartzite at first.\n\nThe ridge becomes grassier lower down but the descent is pretty unrelentingly steep. It eventually leads to path above the Allt Coire a' Mhusgain. Follow this path down to reach the road just east of the Lower Falls car park. Turn right at the road but then immediately right again befeore the bridge to take the path on the near side of the river until Paddy's Bridge at NN158684 before using that to return to the tarmac.

There are good views back over the waters of Loch Cuaich, though these are somewhat spoiled by the ugly tidemark which encircles the reservoir unless it is completely full. Loch Cuaich (then known as Quoich) was created in 1962 as one of the largest of the hydro-electric schemes which brought electricity to the Highlands for the first time.\n\nThe ridge curves round to the left and traverses the two summits of Sgùrr Coire nan Eirichean. There are steep drops down the northern side to Coire a'Chaorainn, and beyond these two summits the ridge is crossed by a drystone dyke and becomes much narrower and better defined. The final climb up to Sgùrr a' Mhaoraich is steep but there are no rocks that cannot be avoided. The summit, at 1027 metres, is a Munro and commands fabulous views. The full extent of Loch Quoich can be seen to the south, whilst the South Glen Shiel Ridge can be seen to the north and northeast. The best part of the view, however, is that to the west over the Knoydart mountains and the sea.\n\nThe easiest route of return is to retrace your steps down the stalkers path. In good weather, however, it is worth continuing the route around Coire a Chaorainn. Follow the flattish summit ridge to the NNW for about 350 metres before descending - with care - the very steep and slippery NNE slopes down to the Bealach Coire a'Chaorainn. The slopes on the far side also rise very steeply and are guarded by crags; the best line up is to keep over to the left side before traversing back right once safely above the steepest section. There are great views of Ladhar Bheinn and Loch Hourn from here.\n\nContinue ENE over the knobbly summits of Am Bathaich. The ridge begins to descend more steeply after the final 817m summit, but you should be able to pick up a stalkers path slightly on the right of the ridge. This zig-zags simply downhill all the way to a hydro track just short of the Allt Coire a'Chaorainn. Turn left along this, then right at a t-junction to soon cross a bridge over the burn. Continue for 700m, passing a building, to another junction; now turn right to continue along the track which leads back to the road by Loch Cuaich.",

    "summary": "Sgùrr Alasdair is the highest peak on Skye - and indeed, the highest UK island summit. The tiny summit is an amazing viewpoint but reaching it involves an arduous slog up scree.",
    "description": "Park just before the campsite at the end of the Glen Brittle road. From here Sgùrr Alasdair looks particularly impressive. The walk starts through the campsite and small gate to keep left of the toilet block and up the prominent path. Go straight across at a rough track. The early part of the route was once an eroded swamp, but following extensive works there is now an excellent pitched-stone constructed footpath.\n\nIgnore a path forking off to the right. As height is gained, great views open up of the Isle of Rum and, later, Eigg. At a large cairn keep straight ahead; from this point the going becomes much rougher. At one point the path heads up a gully between two slabs of rock, scrambling slightly.\n\nAfter the gully, the Loch is only short distance beyond. This is one of the most impressive places in Britain, with the small and beautiful blue lochan surrounded by great sweeps of rock. There are huge slabs, vertical precipices and gigantic stone chutes. Go round the loch to the left and begin the ascent of the most obvious worn scree fan, which is the foot of the Great Stone Chute.\n\nThe lower part of the chute is extremely loose - very much a case of two steps forward, one back, helmets are a sensible precaution. Higher up the chute narrows dramatically and becomes steeper. On this upper section most of the smaller stones have gone and great care must be taken not to dislodge rocks onto any climbers below.\n\nThe saddle at the very top of the stone chute will be a welcome sight. The ridge heading off to the right towards the summit looks fairly scary but turns out to be quite straightforward. The top itself is soon reached; at 992 metres this is the highest mountain on the Isle of Skye. It is named in honour of Sheriff Alexander Nicolson, the Skyeman who made the first ascent.\n\nThe summit is dramatic - even smaller than that on Sgùrr nan Gillean - and the view across the gulf of Coire Lagan to the Inaccessible Pinnacle is fantastic. The view in the other direction, over Coir a' Ghrunnda with its beautiful lochan, is equally fine, whilst a maze of sea and islands stretches away in all directions.\n\nThe best descent route is to return by the route of ascent; the Stone Chute being a little easier in this direction. The ridge leading towards Sgùrr Sgumain has a difficult section - very keen scramblers can ascend by this route as it could be hard to find in descent. Reaching Sgùrr Sgumain from Glen Brittle is straightforward enough (either by the Sgumain stone chute or by ascending over Sròn na Cìche). The difficult section is shortly after the Sgumain col when ascending towards Sgùrr Alasdair; here an impasse in the ridge is avoided by heading out to the right on ledges before ascending a short chimney, though this is out of bounds except to keen scramblers (Grade 5).\n\nOnce back at the lochan in Coire Lagan, be sure to enjoy this stunning location, looking back at the Stone Chute and the peak high above - it is almost impossible to beleive that the route you have just done is feasible.",

There are great views back over Loch Loyne.\n\nThe summit of Creag a' Mhaim is the first Munro of the day at 947 metres. The most strenuous climb of the walk is now already behind, as the marvellous South Glen Shiel Ridge stretches ahead.\n\nThere is only a very short descent to the first col, after which the ridge begins to narrow on the gradual climb up to the second peak.

There are great slabby crags sweeping down into the corries to the north, but the southern slopes are much gentler. The reward is your third Munro, Aonach air Chrith which at 1021m is the highest summit on the whole ridge. From here, most of the rest of the days ridge can be seen winding ahead. Shortly after the summit there is a narrow and rocky section of ridge (which can be bypassed) and soon a narrow grassy path enables a faster pace once more.\n\nThe ridge undulates over a couple of very minor summits before ascending to the fourth Munro, Maol Chinn-Dearg (981metres). From here the path along the ridge bypasses the top of the minor peak of Sgùrr Coire na Feinne before a long slow ascent to munro number five, Sgùrr an Doire Leathain (1010 metres).\n\nThe very summit of this mountain is a short distance along the northeast ridge and requires a slight detour NE. It has a fine view of the next peak, Sgùrr an Lochain which is the most distinctive on the whole ridge. Return to the main ridge, which now has good views down to the loch in Coire Lochain, and climbs easily up to Sgùrr an Lochain (1004 m).\n\nEnjoy the view from this sixth and finest Munro of the day before heading along the seemingly endless ridge once more. The next peak Sgùrr Beag is not a Munro and most walkers have worn a path which avoids its summit, passing to the south side, before the ridge drops to its lowest point at 729 metres with a little lochan. The climb up to the final Munro (Creag nan Dàmh) is likely to be a trial for worn-out limbs. Continue along the ridge and after a pronounced dip, take care on the short, straightforward, scramble up the far side.\n\nStay on the ridge for nearly 2km from the final peak, following the remains of a drystone dyke to the Bealach Duibh Leac where a small cairn marks where to turn north to start the steeper part of the descent. From here follow an old stalkers path, initially faint but marked by some small cairns at first, which winds down the northern slope and is boggy and rocky in places. Further down it becomes clearer and crosses, then leads down the west side of the Allt Coire Mhurlagain. Later on, keep the fence on your left and as the road in the bottom of the glen comes into view, the path forks. The main left branch leads to a ford over the burn, whilst the boggy right hand one veers away from the fence to reach an old footbridge at NG 970134. From here continue down through bracken, in the summer, to a gate leading to the A87. Now all you need to do is get back to your start point several km back up the busy road - there is a layby just to the right.",

    "summary": "The Fisherfield Forest - also known as the Great Wilderness - contains the remotest Munros in all Scotland. The effort required is fully repaid, however, as this is a spectacular region of dramatic peaks and ridges - the views from the summits are often claimed to be the finest in Scotland. The route is an epic round of all five Munros and one Corbett, starting and finishing at Shenavall bothy or a nearby wild camp.",
    "description": "The walk is described from Shenavall bothy; this can be reached via a walk-in from Corrie Hallie as described on the Shenavall route. The bothy is maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting. An alternative is to wild-camp; there is a great spot in the alder woods at NH088788; this is best reached by following the track used as the way back on the Shenavall circuit.\n\nFrom Shenavall Beinn a' Chlaidheimh rises extremely steeply across Strath na Sealga; although it is possible to make a direct assault many walkers will prefer to head up the strath and then approach it from the east, so start along the path which leads ESE. It becomes a track near the ruined house at Achneigie. Continue for another 1.5km - the alder woodland over to the right makes a great spot for a wild camp - until the track begins to climb to the left (bound for Corrie Hallie); instead follow a fainter, grassy track which heads west at this point and leads alongside the Abhainn Loch an Nid. This river must be waded - as with two river crossings at the end of the walk, this is not possible if the level is high.\n\nOn the far side, head directly up the slopes of Beinn Chlaidheimh. After wet but steep heather initially the slope eases to a more gradual grind until the much fiercer upper slopes are reached around 500m. Pass just left of the crags that guard the nose of the main ridge, making your way up steep heather as soon as practical to reach the ridge above at a flattish shoulder. There is then a brief climb up easy scree to gain the narrow summit ridge at point 900m. Follow this airy but grassy ridge across a slight dip to reach the summit cairn, with great views down the very steep west face into the strath, as well as back over the pinnacles of An Teallach. The descent begins almost immediately, with a path down the scree slope to a first bealach at 787m. Continue over a broad and bumpy section of ridge before a second descent leads down to a lower bealach at 650m, marked by a couple of lochans.\n\nContinue south up rough quartzite boulders to gain the very broad NE ridge of Sgùrr Ban. The ridge is littered with rough boulders all the way up the long pull to the top; there is grassier ground further right but this leads onto steeper terrain higher up. The summit cairn is in the centre of a small plateau but the walk continues in the same direction, heading down fairly straightforward slopes to reach the bealach at Cab Coire nan Clach. The next Munro, Mullach Coire Mhic Fhearchair, rises in intimidatingly steep slopes. However, there is an eroded path which leads up scree for the steepest part of the climb, and in good weather it can easily be picked out on the descent from Sgùrr Ban. The slope then eases and continues - still over stones and boulders - to the summit, the highest of the Fisherfield 6.\n\nThe descent is less steep, leading SW and then S, but even more covered with quartzite boulders which make it more time consuming. From the bealach beyond, the steep 851m peak of Meall Garbh appears to be a formidable obstacle, but a bypass path avoids this by cutting across its very steep NW slope to reach a second, lower bealach. From here the slopes of Beinn Tarsuinn are broad and mostly grassy, hiding the drama of the other side of this mountain, which is revealed only as the summit cairn is reached. Follow the narrow ridge to the left to soon reach a square tilted platform which sits astride the mountain and has been likened to a tennis court. A path scrambles easily up onto the 'Tennis Court' to reach a cairn at the far end before descending once more. The next section of ridge is riven into a series of pinnacles, but the walk continues by taking a clear bypass path which runs around the left side.\n\nContinue along the bypass path until a clear path forks off left very steeply down the loose slope. This leads to the extensive and very boggy bealach between Beinn Tarsuinn and A' Mhaighdean - the lowest point of the walk at 525m. The pull up to A' Mhaighdean from here is a very long grind up a broad, grassy slope - a real effort for tired legs. The lure is what is regarded as the remotest of all Munros - and perhaps the finest Munro summit view. The highest point is right on the edge of an abyss as the slopes to the west plunge for 800m down dramatic crags to the Dubh Loch, with Fionn Loch and the sea beyond and amazing rock architecture all around. The view south down to Gorm Loch Mòr and the crags of Beinn Lair is scarcely less impressive, and summiting A' Mhaighdean must be ranked amongst the highlights of a round by any Munroist.\n\nHead towards the more dome-like northern top before descending steep but largely grassy slopes and then rocky ground to reach the Poll Eadar dha Stac, the pass at the foot of Ruadh Stac Mòr . There is a very rough stone bivouac shelter here, which may be of use in an emergency. The last Munro of the round, Ruadh Stac Mòr , rises directly above and the route to it appears to be barred by a band of crags, whilst a stalkers path cuts off to the left to descend past Fuar Loch Mòr . A small cairn, however, marks the point to strike up the well-worn scree slope to reach the foot of the cliffs. The route through the crags above can be picked out during the descent from A' Mhaighdean; it heads up an eroded gully above the scree slope. Getting into the gully requires a straightforward scramble, best started slightly along a ledge to the right from the top of the scree path. From here a big scrambling step up leads onto a wide, well-worn stony gangway that slopes to the left and then continues up the gully before emerging on the boulderfields of the upper slopes.\n\nA faint path winds up the boulders and passes through a gap in the summit crags to reach the cairn. This is another superlative viewpoint in the very heart of the wilderness, surrounded by dramatic rock peaks and glistening lochans; to the north are the Lochan a'Bhragdad backed by the perfect cone of Beinn Dearg Bheag and the pinnacled ridges of Beinn Dearg Mòr beyond. Head along the NNW ridge - negotiating yet more boulderfields - for around 250m before aiming directly between the two lochans to the NE. The slope is terraced with several steeper sections unseen from above. Pass between the lochans and continue north, following a burn down into the hanging valley below. Cross the burn and aim diagonally up the slope opposite to pick up an excellent stalkers path above the Clach na Frithealaidh - a prominent rock.\n\nFollow the path to the right. It angles down towards Loch Beinn Dearg before swinging back to lead easily down Gleann na Muice Beag, eventually leading down to a path running along the Abhainn Ghleann na Muice, a substantial river. Continue down this path to reach the chalet and cottage amidst the group of trees at Larachantivore. Wade the river near here - again, this is impossible in spate. The direct route back to Shenavall now crosses a severe bog, with great care needed to avoid stepping into one of many waist-deep, slime-filled pools, before reaching the second river, the Abhainn Strath na Sealga, just short of the bothy. Alternatively you could continue by the riverbank to the junction of the two rivers. Either way, the second river too needs to be waded before heading back to Shenavall.",

    "description": "Park at the parking area just past the forestry plantations and gated, signed track off the A832 to the south west of Braemore junction. From the parking area walk back along the road for 20 metres until you reach the track leading to Loch a Bhraoin; it is signed for long distance routes to Kinlochewe and Loch Fannich. Go past the barrier and along the track, with views of the mountains ahead. Soon a gate is reached and new paths head off to the left and right - turn left here, following a path which leads through the forestry and then down to a bridge over the outflow of the loch.\n\nFollow the stalker's path on the other side of the bank for a very short distance. As you reach the foot of the ridge heading up to Tomain Coinich turn right onto a boggy path heading straight up the slope of Leitir Fhearna, the nose of the ridge. From here the slope higher up looks rocky but it presents no difficulties apart from wet ground; the path easily negotiates the rocky sections.\n\nOnce past the rocky part the ridge flattens and there is a plateau riven with peat gullies. Avoid the worst of the peat by following the path round the right edge to reach the grassier ridge beyond. This gives a gentle and enjoyable climb, with good views of the corries in front of the Munros on either side. Do not be tempted to stay on the path traversing the right hand side of the ridge, this path eventually leads to the col between Toman Coinich and A Chailleach across a very steep and rocky final slope; it is better to follow the crest of ridge straight to the summit of Toman Coinich.\n\nFrom the summit of Toman Coinich there are fine views down to Loch Fannich and the surrounding hills. Follow the south easterly broad ridge down to the col, crossing wide bare steps caused by glaciation in the last ice age. From the col it is a straightforward climb to Sgùrr Breac. The true summit is not the first cairn on the little rise but is a couple of hundred metres further east atop of flat plateau, giving little impression of the cliffs to the north. This is the first Munro of the day, at 1000 metres.\n\nRetrace your steps to Tomain Coinich and then descend the indistinct ridge to the bealach opposite before climbing steadily up the grassy and much more well defined and enjoyable ridge up the far side; there are great views down the cliffs on the right side down to Loch Toll an Lochain in the corrie floor.\n\nKeep following the ridge as it flattens off at the junction with Sròn an Goibhre ridge (most easily identified by the old fence post stumps going off down the slope to the right). Here bear left, following the path to reach the summit of A Chailleach, the second Munro of the day, and a superb viewpoint both over Loch Fannich and into the remote peaks of the Fisherfield Forest.\n\nTo find the descent route return north east to where the fence posts led off and start descending the ridge of Sròn na Goibhre (no path). The descent is fairly steep to start with and then becomes gentle as it follows the spur. The ridge climbs slightly, crossing a rocky-knoll like summit.\n\nA couple of hundred metres beyond these is the best place to begin the very steep descent down the right flank of the ridge to the coire near the outflow of Loch Toll an Lochain. The slope is mostly steep grass and bog with some greasy boulders, but must be tackled to avoid the crags at the termination of the ridge to the north. Once down in the corrie turn left alongside the burn, crossing it as soon as possible. Further on ground steepens and the stream cascades into a ravine with a series of waterfalls; this is negotiated with a descending traverse to the right.\n\nBeyond the waterfalls, continue heading downhill diagonally towards Loch a Bhraoin. Note a fine sheepfold off to the left. Eventually a very boggy and faint ATV track can be picked up, aiming for the far corner of a fenced area. Pass this corner and continue to the shores of Loch a' Bhroain. Now follow the very rough and boggy track back to the bridge at the outflow of the loch. Cross this to return to the A832 by the outward route.",

Walk back down cross the road and take the track opposite over the railway level crossing. The track bends left and heads up the glen. There are great views ahead of Sgùrr nan Ceannaichean.

The burn is usually easily crossed in normal water conditions - or there is a new wire bridge around 20-30m upstream.\n\nThe first part of the stalkers path uphill has been widened to a track creating a scar on this part of the landscape. However it soon narrows back to a path which ascends the west side of the glen of the Allt Leathad an Tobair, with good views of Sgùrr Chòinnich. It keeps high above the stream, to reach the wide Bealach Bhearnais.\n\nBear left as the path continues to climb up to the second, higher bealach where there is a short section of old wall. Turn left to begin the ascent of the Streangan nan Aon Pacan-deug ridge. This is broad at first but narrows and becomes more defined as height is gained. It is mostly grassy but has three rocky bands to negotiate, all are easy with rock steps.\n\nThe ridge leads directly up to the narrow summit ridge, with the small summit cairn right on the edge of the crags. The summit ridge is straight and level apart from a brief dip and has a good view over the void of Pollan Buidhe. The summit cairn is a tantalising 999 metres high.\n\nFrom here, continue to the far end of the summit ridge and then descend the rocky ridge to the Bealach Coire Chòinnich. The path is eroded in places and there are views down to Loch Monar on the right. The ascent on the far side of the bealach is straightforward, rocky in a couple of places, leads to the large shelter cairn on the summit of Sgùrr a'Chaorachain. This is the higher of the two Munros at 1053 metres and on a clear day there are good views to the main Torridon summits to the north.\n\nUnless returning the same way or continuing to Maoile Lunndaidh, head north from the summit, down a grassy ridge for about 700 metres before bearing left (northwest) down the relentlessly steep slope that is boggy in places – the reward being the views of Sgùrr Chòinnich to the left.\n\nThere's a great aerial view of the long walk back too. As the gradient eases aim directly north to eventually cross the Allt a'Chonais to regain the track before heading back down the glen.",

Well seen from the popular viewpoint of the Commando Memorial near Spean Bridge, their summits are covered with the quartzite scree that gives these mountains their name. The traverse of the Grey Corries main ridge gives a long and demanding but superb mountain walk. The route as described takes in the main three Munros, leaving a fourth for a separate walk.",
    "description": "The start of this walk is several kilometres up a very rough track from Corriechoille, itself just beyond the end of a minor road from Spean Bridge. Driving the track requires great care. The best place to park is where another track branches right at NN252793. Begin the walk by continuing on the track southeast. It soon passes further parking space where it crosses the line of a now-vanished tramway connected with the Fort William aluminium works. Pass through a gate, soon passing the Wee Minister - a wooden replacement for an old stone statue who looks out back across the glen. Continue ahead past areas of forestry with great views back.\n\nOnce the plantation on the right ends, go through the gate, but continue on the track to a second gate to avoid entering the enclosed square of ground on the right. After the second gate turn right across very boggy, pathless terrain, passing around the enclosed area and then steeply uphill with the fence and forest to your right. After passing the steepest lower slopes curve south up the open and grassy but wet slopes leading up to Stob Coire Gaibhre, a long and unremitting ascent. From here, the walk improves dramatically, with views across the corrie on the left with its tiny lochan to the outlying top of Stob Coire na Ceannain. There is a very brief descent before a gradual and then steeper and stonier climb up to point 1121m.\n\nUnless you wish to make a detour out to Stob Coire na Ceannain, ignore the ridge leading off east, instead making a brief steep climb to gain the sharp slabby arête ahead. The crest here is narrow but easily bypassed by paths on the right side. It leads up to a first cairned summit (the photo shows the view back from here); continue along the crest to reach Stob Choire Claurigh. This first Munro of the day is the fifteenth highest mountain in Britain and enjoys a fine panorama. The outlier of the Grey Corries, Stob Ban, is to the south, but most eyes will be on the snaking main ridge leading away to the west.\n\nThe ridge leading on is broad and stony initially but there is a worn path that eases the going. It descends at first before a slight climb up to point 1105m. The ridge now curves gracefully and narrows as it descends on grass before a stony pull onto a rocky crest bordered by steep crags on the left side, before continuing to the next minor summit, Stob Coire Cath na Sine.\n\nThe ridge now switches direction more to the west, and crosses another area of stones before the ascent up to Caisteal at 1106m. From here there is a great view of the next section of ridge leading to the second Munro, Stob Coire an Laoigh, with steep crags on the right.\n\nFrom Stob Coire an Laoigh there is a stony descent and climb to the next summit, Stob Coire Easain at 1080 metres. Now, a decision must be made. If you have enough energy, it is well worth continuing along the ridge to take in a third Munro, Sgùrr Chòinnich Mhòr - the most shapely of the Grey Corries, before returning to this point. Those who are already tired will want to omit this part of the walk and continue at paragraph 5. To include the extra peak, head down the well defined ridge to the south southwest to reach the wide Bealach Coire Easain. The next section of ascent is very steep, followed by a fine ridge leading to the summit of the pyramidal peak of Sgùrr Chòinnich Mòr . This is the third Munro of the day at 1094m. Return to the bealach and back up to Stob Coire Easain.\n\nDescend the initially steep and stony slopes to the north northeast. These soon become easier angled and grassy, becoming a better defined ridge with some minor peaks over Beinn na Socaich. There are excellent views back to the main Grey Corries ridge.\n\nContinuing the descent, the slopes become increasingly open and grassy, and finally tussocky and wet in places. Once the edge of the forestry draws close aim for a pedestrian gate in the forest fence. From here an ill-defined path leads through a gap in the young forestry plantation. Continue ahead until a minor hillock; the path improves to lead down to the left of this, emerging on a forest track. Turn right along the track.\n\nThe track soon leads over a bridge; continue slightly uphill to reach a t-junction. Most guidebooks recommend taking the line of the old tramway back to the start, but much of the route has become extremely boggy and overgrown, and the bridges are missing. Instead turn left and follow the track downhill. At a track junction (with Spean Bridge signed ahead) follow the main track which bends right. Ignore a track off to the left, and at a second junction take the left fork downhill (ignoring the track climbing slightly right). This eventually leads back to the access track from Coirecoille and the start.",

    "description": "Park just before the campsite at the end of the Glen Brittle road. The walk starts up the prominent path just left of the campsite toilet block. The early part of the route was once an eroded swamp, but following extensive works there is now an excellent pitched-stone constructed footpath. Go straight across at a rough track, then higher up turn right at a fork onto the path for Coire Ghrunnda, soon crossing a burn.\n\nThe path swings round the base of Sròn na Cìche before heading up the left side of lower Coire Ghrunnda. The base of the corrie is made up of huge sweeps of bare, glaciated slabs - impressive to look at but difficult to negotiate. Keep to the path which climbs high up the left side of the corrie.\n\nFurther on the path descends closer to the stream (with a cascading waterfall) and the way up to the upper corrie is barred by cliffs. The route can be continued by a moderate scramble up the rocks to the left of the waterfall. Just beyond, Coire Ghrunnda is reached. This is one of the most beautiful and impressive of all the Cuillin corries, benefiting from being much less visited than Coire Lagan.\n\nTo continue the ascent, head round to the right of the loch and then begin to climb the steep boulder field beyond aiming almost directly for Sgùrr nan Eag - there are a few small paths but you need to plan your route from the vantage point of the loch in order to avoid any crags (an easier, though longer route, would be to climb the boulders to the left of the prominent boss of rock, Caisteal a Garbh Choire and once on the ridge follow the path to the left to regain the route). The boulders in the coire give awkward going but have exceptionally good friction; they are made of peridotite, a variant of gabbro which is even rougher than normal.\n\nOnce on the ridge the views - both over to Coruisk and back down over Coire Ghrunnda to Sgùrr Alasdair- are breathtaking. Turn right along the ridge. The ascent to Sgùrr nan Eag can either be made fairly directly up the ridge (moderate scrambling) or by using a path in the scree lower down on the right (no scrambling; careful route finding needed).\n\nThe summit cairn is in the centre of the long, narrow summit ridge. At 924m this is the southernmost of the Cuillin Munros. The easiest way back is to return the same way. It is possible to continue all the way along the ridge to Gars-bheinn, where the Cuillin end above the sea - this is a delightful excursion but the return should still be made over Sgùrr nan Eag. Keen scramblers and Munro-baggers may want to include Sgùrr Dubh Mòr in the day's itinerary.\n\nTo take in Sgùrr Dubh Mòr , return along the ridge to Caisteal a Garbh Coire, and avoid this obstacle by passing round its base to the right. Beyond the bealach, the ascent of Sgùrr Dubh na Da Bheinn is a rocky scramble (keep slightly to the left of the ridge). From the summit, bear east down to the bealach, and then you must find a route up Sgùrr Dubh Mòr beyond.\n\nThe normal route is to head round to the right a little before finding a way up from ledge to ledge until the summit is reached. Either way, the ascent is a hard scramble and involves very tricky route finding; if at all unsure, why not hire a guide. With luck, the summit ridge of Sgùrr Dubh Mòr will be reached - there is a first cairn and then a second summit which may be marginally the higher of the two.\n\nReturn to Sgùrr Dubh na Da Bheinn. The return to Coire Ghrunnda can be made either by heading back down to Caisteal a Garbh Coire and descending from there, or by heading along the ridge towards the Thearlaich-Dubh gap before descending the boulders. Once back at the lochan, the return is by the route of ascent.",

    "description": "The walk begins from the car park adjacent to St Paul's Church in Kinlochleven; it is signed 'Grey Mare's Tail' from the main road (it is no longer possible to start from the former Mamore Lodge Hotel). From the Kinlochleven car park follow the path from the edge of the car park into the woods; it is signed for 'Spean Bridge' and 'Corrour Station'. Almost at once the path reaches a t-junction; turn left here. After a short distance on the surfaced path, keep right as signed for Loch Èilde Mòr. When the path forks, keep left, crossing a small burn. The route climbs up through the deciduous woodland and gives increasingly good views back over Kinlochleven and Loch Leven behind. As the path climbs the original zig-zagging stalkers path has been short-cutted by a variety of eroded, direct routes; it is best to keep to the original route to avoid worsening the erosion. Soon the trees are left behind and more open moorland is reached.\n\nContinue on the clear path across the moor until it eventually reaches a vehicle track. Turn left here very briefly before turning right again to continue in the original direction on another stalkers path. This slopes uphill before crossing a stream and then beginning to climb across the steep flanks of Sgòr Èilde Beag. There are good views over Loch Èilde Mòr and to the Blackwater Reservoir and Dam in the distance. Watch out for a sharp zig-zag to the left at one point, marked by a tumbledown cairn; there is a faint path continuing straight ahead created by walkers who have missed this.\n\nThe route traverses round Sgòr Èilde Beag, curving to the left, keeping high above the loch but below the cliffs. There is an impressive but daunting view of Sgùrr Èilde Mòr across the lochan; our route saves this peak for the return journey. Continue on the stalkers path until it reaches a four-way junction. The left branch climbs up towards Binnein Mòr , whereas the sharp right turn heads for Sgùrr Èilde Mòr . Continue ahead on a path which slopes downhill a little, curving to the left before beginning to descend into the Coire a Bhinnein valley. The clear path descends to the stream in this valley via a series of zigzags, before crossing the stream. Continue downstream for a short distance before the stalkers path heads off to the left, beginning to climb once more.\n\nKeep to the clear but somewhat boggy stalkers path as it climbs across the hillsides all the way to the lochan on the bealach between Binnein Mòr and Binnein Beag. To ascend Binnein Beag, follow the faint path on the near side of this lochan which begins to climb up the broken south ridge. This ridge has boulders and scree but there is a path for most of the climb which helps; there is a short, avoidable scrambly section near the top.\n\nThe summit of Binnein Beag is 943 metres, making it the second lowest of the Mamores Munros. This belies the fact that its remote position makes it perhaps the hardest of the range to reach. There are extensive views over the bleak headwaters of Glen Nevis, with Ben Nevis towering to the north together with the Grey Corries. The most impressive part of the view however is looking back down the route of ascent to the lochan far below, with Binnein Mòr towering above. Return back down to the lochan by the route of ascent, and all the way back across the Coire a Bhinnein valley and up the zig-zag path on the far side.\n\nReturn to the junction mentioned earlier, then turn left towards the west ridge of Sgùrr Èilde Mòr. Follow the path as it climbs round onto the northwest face before making a final climb up to the crest of the west ridge via steep, eroded scree. The summit of Sgùrr Èilde Mòr is 1010m, just a short distance along this ridge to the left. It has a stunning view across the lochan to the main Mamores ridge.\n\nDescend back down the path and follow it to the junction of stalkers paths mentioned earlier. Turn left here to retrace the stalkers path back round and down to the vehicle track below Loch Èilde Mòr . To vary the return to Kinlochleven, you can turn right along the stalkers track, passing a stone bench with a superb view of Loch Leven. Just after the bench turn left onto a path heading downhill. This descends into the valley ahead to another path junction; again turn left. Follow the main path through the woodland, keeping left once again at a waymarked junction, to descend a steep, eroded trench-like section through the trees. Turn right beyond this to reach a footbridge. You can visit the impressive Grey Mare's Tail waterfall by detouring straight ahead here; otherwise cross the bridge and climb the steps before following the path back to the car park.",

    "description": "The road up Glen Strathfarrar is private and vehicular access is strictly controlled at the locked gate at Milton Cottage near Struy and a maximum number of 25 cars allowed in a day. In the summer months the gate is open from 9am to between 6 - 8pm depending on the month; it is closed all day Tuesday and until 1.30pm on Wednesdays. In the winter access must be arranged in advance through Mountaineering Scotland. See their page on Strathfarrar access for further details. There are no access restrictions for walkers or cyclists and there is a car park near Milton Cottage. To start this walk, drive along the Glen until a flat grassy area between Loch Beannacharan and Loch a' Mhuillidh is reached. Here a track heads north and there is parking on the grass just off the track. Follow the track uphill.\n\nContinue on the track past the small dam on the stream and continue uphill. Where a small path branches off to the left, continue for a very short while on the faint track and follow a clearer path to the left - they both eventually join up as they follow the Allt Coire Mhuillidh upstream. At this point the second Munro of the day, Càrn nan Gobhar can be seen straight ahead, a rather insignificant looking grassy dome, and the first summit, Sgùrr na Ruaidhe, slightly to the right looks very easy, but much of the ascent cannot be seen from this angle. After crossing the first side stream, climb up the easy grassy slope in a north east direction - there is a faint path but at times this is indistinct and boggy.\n\nBefore you reach the top, a stone shelter is reached and then the summit cairn a little further on at 993m. The walk to the Bealach nam Botaichean in a north, west north direction is on lovely spongy moss and grass which is very easy going. There is a small steep section to the actual col and then a long and straightforward pull up first north north west and then as the steepness eases, westwards, to the summit of Càrn nan Gobhar. The last few metres are covered in boulders and there is a small cairn at the north edge at 992 metres where there is a good view of the route up Sgùrr a'Choire Ghlais.\n\nFrom the cairn, retrace your steps along the ridge south over the boulders a short way and then follow the pleasant grassy ridge southwards and then south west as it steepens to Bealach Sneachda at 865m. The steep pull up the other side is straightforward with a small path and a boulder section near the top. There is are two large cairns on the summit (1083m) and a trig point in between. There are good views north to Glen Orrin, Strathconon and to the Fannichs beyond. From the northern cairn, you can descend the rocky ridge or bypass the boulders by heading west from the trig point and then heading back north to the ridge to continue north west along the clear ridge.\n\nThe descent to Bealach Toll Sgaile is straightforward and as the ridge narrows and the views of Creag Ghorm a'Bhealaich improve makes an impressive section of the walk. On the ascent the summit of Creag Ghorm a'Bhealaich can be bypassed but the tiny detour to the top is worth it for the dramatic views down into the coire. From here there is only a small descent before the final pull to the summit of Sgùrr Fhuar-thuill at 1049m.\n\nFrom the summit continue west, just beyond the col at 987m a stalkers path leaves the ridge to the south west - a small cairn marks the spot. From here there are great views across to the slabby face of Sgùrr na Muice with Loch Toll a' Mhuic below. Follow the clear path as it descends steeply at first and then traverses below the ridge and descends to the eastern side of the Loch. Keep following the path until it crosses the stream and later becomes a track and follows the course of the Allt Toll a' Mhuic downhill with some impressive waterfalls and pleasant birchwoods. Eventually the track emerges onto the Glen Strathfarrar road. Turn left here and follow the road for the 6km to return to the start, passing Braulen Lodge on the way.",

    "description": "The starting point of the walk is the Glen Shiel car park (not layby) on the A87 east of a gap in the forestry, there is an information board about the Glen Shiel battle and a wooden Hill Path sign. Note that this is a one-way walk and you'll need to use public transport, bike, or a lift back up the road to return to this start point. Take the path west from the car park, soon turning right to follow a boggy path steeply up the slopes to the north keeping the forestry fence on your right. This first climb of the day is barely a kilometre long, but very steep as 550 metres have to be gained to reach the Bealach an Lapain. At the corner of the forestry fence, turn left to head directly uphill on a fainter path marked with a tiny cairn. The route zigzags up the hillside above but never stops heading hard uphill until the Bealach na Lapain is reached.\n\nOnce at the bealach, relax, as the hardest part of the day is already behind. To the left (west) stretches a magnificent ridgewalk; Sgùrr Fhuaran, highest of the Five Sisters, is seen in the distance ahead, but the first climb is along the long and undulating but fine ridge to the top of Sgùrr nan Spainteach (the peak of the Spaniards). From here the descent is a little rocky, and just before the bealach there is a short rock scramble to descend. Beyond this, the ridge has two separate crests with a depression between - very confusing in misty conditions. The path heads up the right hand crest at first before switching left.\n\nAfter a steep climb the massive summit cairn of Sgùrr na Ciste Duibhe, the first Munro of the day at 1027 metres is reached; continue a short distance beyond to get a superb full length view down Loch Duich. From here, the ridge along the Five Sisters proper is broader and less well defined than that already traversed, though it is very steep, rough and bouldery. Continue down to the Bealach na Craoibhe.\n\nThe next Munro, Sgùrr na Càrnach (1002 metres) is gives very rough going, but there is a path winding up the stony slopes to the top. Sgùrr na Càrnach only became a Munro in 1997, but most Munroists had already climbed it as part of the ridge. Beyond, there is almost an identical descent to the Bealach na Càrnach, with a little very easy rocky scrambling on flakes. Beyond, the ascent to Sgùrr Fhuaran beyond is again steep and bouldery.\n\nSgùrr Fhuaran is the highest and central of the Five Sisters at 1067 metres, and the third and final Munro of the day. The west ridge of Sgùrr Fhuaran is the first reasonable descent route to Glen Shiel since the Bealach na Lapain; it gives a very long and fairly steep route down to the valley. Many walkers opt to make this descent; if doing this, continue along the valley floor. The footbridge across the river just east of Loch Shiel marked on OS maps is gone, so if following this descent it is necessary to continue along the north side until reaching the road.\n\nPurists and aesthetes, however, will want to continue the ridge walk. It is necessary to descend the west ridge for around three hundred metres to avoid steep ground; at this point, follow the path which cuts back off the west ridge and joins the north ridge. This continues to descend to reach the Bealach Buidhe. The next peak on the ridge is Sgùrr nan Saighead; this is not a Munro, and the main path bypasses the summit. It is well worth keeping to the ridge, however, as the northeast slopes of this peak are the steepest and most impressive in the whole Five Sisters range. Continue along the ridge from the summit down to the next bealach, with more great views down fearsome gulleys into Coire na h-Uaighe.\n\nAfter crossing a minor bump, the steep peak of Beinn Bhuidhe appears ahead. One path heads left here, avoiding Beinn Bhuidhe and descending its northwest ridge. If taking this option, follow the path down the ridge, descending steeply at one point beside a stream, to reach the flat bog of Fasach an t-Searraich. From here, head north and cross the Allt a Chruinn before following the path down its north bank. The other option is to scramble to the top of Beinn Buidhe, and then down its rocky NNE ridge to the next bealach. From here the purist can ascend the fifth sister, Sgùrr na Moraich, before returning to the bealach and descending to the start of the path down the north bank of the Allt a Chruinn, soon passing a waterfall. Continue down the path on the north bank, which soon improves and follows the line of a stalkers path. Lower down the hillside the stream falls into a gorge; the path swings right here before making a winding descent of the hillside. It passes through a gate lower down, and emerges into Allt a'chruinn village beside the waterworks. You are now about 13 kilometres from where you began the walk.",

    "description": "Park in the large layby off the A832 around 250 metres to the east of the Dundonnell Hotel. The walk begins a little further along the road (heading away from the Hotel), turning off onto a path to the right just before the pair of bungalows to pass behind them, through a gate and up the hillside. The path, which is a little boggy in places, zig-zags to and fro as it climbs up onto the ridge of Meall Garbh. Try to keep to this old path up this ridge rather than following the clearer path ahead towards the Allt a Mhuillin, which is a boggier route. There are fine views along the rocky ridge of Meall Garbh; beyond the path contours round the smoothly-contoured slopes at the head of the valley, before beginning to climb once more towards Sròn a Choire. There are great views to the north over towards the Summer Isles.\n\nBeyond Sròn a' Choire the route climbs slightly to reach a col which is almost paved with flat sandstone slabs. From here, climb steeply up the scree and boulder ridge to the south; there's a worn path heading up the flank to the ridge of the ridge line. Eventually a short climb to the left leads to the trig point on the summit of Bidein a'Ghlas Thuill. This is the highest of An Teallach's two Munros at 1062 metres. It has extensive views in all directions but all eyes will be pointing southwest, where a truly stupendous panorama of Sgùrr Fiona and the Corrag Buidhe pinnacles make an amazing backdrop to the void of Coire Toll an Lochain. There is no more impressive sight amongst Scottish mountains.\n\nFollow the rocky ridge southwest, with immense views on the left side. The ridge descends to a bealach before rising intimidatingly steeply towards Sgùrr Fiona.\n\nThis ridge can either be followed by scrambling up it directly near the corrie edge, or follow an easier path across the northern face of Sgùrr Fiona to instead reach its summit up its rocky but straightforward northwest ridge. Either way, the cairn on this second Munro at 1060 will be reached. This is a finer summit than Bidein a' Ghlas Thuill but doesn't share that peak's sudden drama; its view along Corrag Buidhe is very impressive nonetheless.\n\nContinue along the ridge; a path leads down to a bealach at the foot of Lord Berkeley's Seat, a fearsome-looking pinnacle which actually overhangs Coire Toll an Lochain. Lord Berkeley is supposed to have sat on the top with his legs dangling over the edge whilst he smoked a pipe. Here a decision must be made; the ascent of the Seat is fairly simple though exposed scrambling, but beyond the Seat, the ridge offers more scrambling over the multiple pinnacles of Corrag Buidhe. The final descent off Corrag Buidhe is a graded rock climb and scene of several fatal accidents; if you've gone this far, it is necessary to head back a little and look for a way down to the bypass path which is on the right hand side of the ridge.\n\nAlternatively, you can avoid the scrambling by taking a bypass path that begins from the foot of Lord Berkeley's Seat. This descends a little and cuts across the west flank of Corrag Bhuidhe; when it forks, the higher route is the easier option. Whether you've taken the bypass or the ridge, the two routes rejoin beyond Corrag Buidhe Buttress and the main scrambling difficulties are left behind. You can continue along a narrow ridge, or descend stony ground more directly to head to the bealach at the foot of Stob Cadha Gobhlach.\n\nThe ridge then climbs up steeply, then eases before reaching the final sharp peak of Stob Gadha Gobhlach, with a good retrospective view of Corrag Buidhe. Descend an eroded path to another bealach before climbing once more to the final, more rounded peak of Sàil Liath.\n\nFrom Sàil Liath take a long last look back at the magnificent cirque you have completed. From here, a fairly broad ridge descends southeast at first; as this begins to to steepen, bear right slightly down the slope to avoid any crags; this part of the descent is stony and loose. Aim well to the south of the small Lochan na Brathan to eventually reach the stalkers' path from Corrie Hallie to Shenavall a short distance beyond.\n\nTurn left along this path which undulates before joining a vehicle track; keep left here. The vehicle track now leads all the way back to the A832. This is some fine woodland in Gleann Chaorach; at one point the track fords the stream in this glen. If the water is high there is an alternative footbridge which can be reached with muddy boots. Just over two kilometres further on the track, after passing through a gate, joins the A832 at Corrie Hallie. This is parking here, but if you have left your car at the start of the walk in Dundonnell you have another three kilometres or more of road walking to do - turn left along the road.",

    "description": "Park just before the campsite at the end of the Glen Brittle road, where there is a sandy beach. The walk starts through the campsite and small gate to keep left of the toilet block and up the prominent path. Go straight across when a rough track is reached. The early part of the route was once an eroded swamp, but following extensive works there is now an excellent pitched-stone constructed footpath.\n\nIgnore a path forking off to the right. As height is gained, great views open up of the Isle of Rum and, later, Eigg. After passing a large cairn (a path goes off to the left here, which will be used in descent) the ground becomes rougher. At one point the path heads up a gully between two slabs of rock, scrambling slightly.\n\nAfter the gully, the Loch is only short distance beyond. This is one of the most impressive places in Britain, with the small and beautiful blue lochan surrounded by great sweeps of rock. There are huge slabs, vertical precipices and gigantic stone chutes, with the summit of Sgùrr Mhic Chòinnich visible at the back of the coire.\n\nGo round the loch to the left and head to the back of the corrie. The route now involves an ascent of the An Stac screes - a wide slope of unstable scree. It is very much a case of two steps up and one step back. It is safer to keep to the side of the scree in case anyone higher up dislodges a rock and take care not to send rocks down on anyone below, helmets are a sensible precaution.\n\nThe route emerges on the ridge at Bealach Coire Lagan. On the left, the great buttress of An Stac rises up impressively. Turn right along the ridge, heading across a fairly flat section before a short descent leads to the lowest point of on the corrie headwall. From here the scrambling along the ridge is not too difficult at first, weaving a route up various blocks and grooves. The views back are sensational.At a slight flattening about two thirds of the way up the exit from Collie's Ledge (or Hart's Ledge) is seen on the right. Immediately above this is the trickiest section - a short but very steep rise in the ridge. This is a hard scramble with yawning exposure, made worse by the knowledge that it will seem even trickier in descent.\n\nOnce past this the rest of the ridge remains exposed but without any difficult obstacles. The summit is soon reached - an extremely dramatic spot, the partial remins of a memorial plaque are concreted to the cairn.\n\nThere is a vertical descent on the ridge just beyond the summit so it is necessary instead to return the same way - unless abseiling! The easiest way back is to reverse the whole of the route of ascent, though very experienced and competent scramblers might attempt Collie's Ledge.",

    "description": "Park in the small parking area just north of Torrandhu bridge on the A835. There is a Met Office weather station here. Rather than head up beside the boggy burn, a signpost instead points to a start which leads briefly east along the road. Cross the bridge and then take a right turn onto a track into the forestry. After 2.5km turn right downhill, emerging from the trees and crossing a bridge over Abhainn an Torrain Dubh. On the far side the track continues as a rough ATV track, which is boggy and intermittent in places. It does, however, assist with the ascent up towards Creag Dubh Fannaich.\n\nWhen the ATV track swings left at around 560m leave it and continue on a faint path. This peters out; continue to reach the minor summit of Creag Dhubh Fannaich, marked by a small cairn; the view extends back over Loch Glascarnoch, whilst the final two Munros on today's route look impressive above lochan-filled corries. Continue across a broad bealach and begin the ascent of Beinn Liath Mhòr Fannaich itself up a mixture of grass and boulders. The cairn on the summit, the first Munro of the day at 953 metres, is towards the western end of the small plateau, by some rocky outcrops. A good view opens out westwards over Loch a'Mhadaidh, with the prominent dome-like summit of Sgùrr Mòr towering to its left.\n\nThe intervening bealach can very difficult to locate in misty conditions, with intervening steep, stony and very loose terrain. It's probably best to descend just slightly north of west from the summit for a short distance, soon over steep stony and loose ground, to meet a stalkers path that cuts across the west side of the mountain. Turn left along this, which cuts through the steep ground and zig-zags down to the bealach. The stalkers path continues up the far side of the bealach and passes to the left of a minor peak before the ridge narrows briefly. As the ridge broadens again, the stalkers path contours round to the left; leave the path here and climb more directly up the steep slopes towards Sgùrr Mòr - again with big drops on the right.\n\nThe slope eases shortly before the impressively built summit cairn on the summit of Sgùrr Mòr is reached. At 1110 metres, this second Munro is the highest summit for miles around, and its impressive 'witches hat' outline marking it out in distant views from other mountains across the region. The view, as might be expected, is very extensive, with Sgùrr nan Clach Geala looking very impressive close at hand, and An Teallach commanding to the northwest.\n\nDescend back down the south ridge, briefly retracing steps before continuing down a slope eroded into a series of terraces made by a process known as solufluction during the last ice-age. From the bealach continue up over the minor summit of Meall nan Peithirean with its flat rocks. There are excellent views to the north all along this ridge down into a series of rocky, lochan-filled corries. The path descends gently down the far side of this top to reach a bealach, and after passing to the right of the bump of Creachan Rairigidh reaches a second bealach. Here the path forks, with a branch to the south descending towards Loch Fannich; our route follows the path which climbs up to the summit of Meall Gorm. This flat-topped Munro is the third of the walk, and has a height of 949 metres.\n\nThe ridge continues east, passing a curious and partly collapsed stone shelter presumably built by stalkers. Continue to a final top at 922m before descending steeper stony ground to reach the wide Bealach Ban. From the bealach, continue up the very wide grass and scree-covered slopes to the summit plateau - it is possible to avoid the scree by taking a traverse to the right part way up the slope - once beyond the scree ascent grassy slopes direct to the summit.\n\nThe summit of the fourth Munro, An Coileachan, is marked by a well-built cairn atop a sandstone outcrop. There's a great view looking along to the termination of the ridge at An Eigin, backed by Loch Luichart, as well as looking back over the whole range and Loch Fannich.\n\nHead north across the plateau before picking your way steeply down a stonier section - any difficulties can be avoided to the left side - heading in the direction of Loch Gorm. Once on flatter ground follow a more defined path to the bealach southwest of Meallan Buidhe. The route on from here becomes very boggy and very rough, though with a path of sorts at first. Contour the west side of Meallan Buidhe and aim a little east of north across the moors - the path fades out - to reach the Abhainn a'Ghuibhais Li at a bridge. Cross and then follow the far bank of the burn downstream to the second bridge used on the ascent. Cross this to retrace your steps via the forest track - with some unwelcome ascent - back to the car park.",

    "description": "Park in the car park on the west side of the Abhainn Coire Mhic Nobuil, about three kilometres west of Torridon village. Have a look at the river from the bridge- there are some attractive waterfalls here- before taking the path up the west side of the stream (not the much larger path on the east side).\n\nThe path soon crosses the deer fence at a stile, continuing up the moor to reach the stream issuing from the deep scoop of Coir nan Laogh. Continue up the path into the corrie.\n\nThe clear but rough path zig-zags straightforwardly up the corrie, keeping to the west side of the stream. After a long climb, it emerges on a fairly flat plateau. The triangulation point marking the summit of Tom na Gruagaich, at 922 metres, is soon reached over to the right. This was once a mere Top but in 1997 it was promoted and it is now the lower of Beinn Alligin's two Munros. It is a fabulous viewpoint, with a vast swathe of the sea topped off with the Isle of Skye, whilst to the east, Liathach is seen end-on.\n\nBest of all, however, is the view of the ridgewalk ahead. Head down the narrow north ridge of Tom na Gruagaich, which is steep and rocky in places with some simple scrambling - easier ground is on the left. From the col, climb up over a minor top; beyond this the ridge levels off briefly before beginning the final steeper climb up to Sgùrr Mhor.\n\nShortly before reaching the summit, the ridge is split by the Eag Dubh or Black Cleft, a tremendously dramatic gully on the southeast side. This is easily passed on the left side. Beyond, the second and highest of Beinn Alligin's two Munro summits, Sgùrr Mhòr at 986 metres, is quickly reached.\n\nThis is an even better viewpoint, with Baosbheinn looking fabulous across Loch a Bhealaich to the north; but the pick of the view is that of the incredibly steep peak of Beinn Dearg with the Horns of Alligin as a foreground. If you don't like scrambling or if the weather is poor, you can return from here back the way you came; taking this option would reduce the difficulty of the walk to Grade 4.\n\nDescend the ridge that dips steeply towards the first of the Horns. The three Horns of Alligin, Na Rathanan in Gaelic, are a landmark from many points miles around, and together with the steep domed top of Sgùrr Mhòr make Beinn Alligin easy to identify in distant views. There is a faint path which traverses the very steep grass slopes to the right of the first two horns, but this can be very slippery and is probably more dangerous than climbing over the Horns themselves. Instead follow the path which winds up the first Horn, with some very simple - a rocky staircase. The top is a narrow but level ridge, before a steep descent to the foot of the second Horn. The ascent of this one is short and direct with one steeper scrambling move and little alternative.\n\nThe final Horn has three options; it can be avoided entirely by a bypass path on the right, tackled fairly direct initially before heading right along a ledge and then heading up a chimney, or via a path which makes an ascending traverse to the right and reaches the top via a simple rocky staircase. The descent of the far side is straightforward. The way down then continues for some distance before easing at around 600m. Beyond this flatter section, the descent becomes extremely steep, and would be very tricky with sandstone terraces hidden from above if it wasn't for a clear path; as it is, it still requires care with some easy scrambling. There are superb views looking to the hidden side of Liathach. From the foot of the ridge keep heading down towards the Allt a Bhealaich, soon another path joins from the left at a cairn.\n\nThe path leads on down to reach a footbridge and then crosses this before descending the east bank, passing some waterfalls, before crossing the Abhainn Coire Mhic Nobuil on another footbridge. Continue on the excellent path down the east bank, which returns to the car park.",

    "description": "The minor road up Loch Arkaig is something of a roller-coaster journey; continue to the end of the public road where there is a new car park. Begin the walk by passing through the gate at the end of the road. Soon the track forks; take the right branch, which is signed for Morar and Tomdoun - both testing cross-country routes. Keep straight on along the track when the Tomdoun route goes off to the right shortly afterwards. The track briefly runs close by the river and there are good views up Glen Dessary, with the Corbett of Bidein a'Chabhair, its peaked summit, looking very prominent.\n\nContinue on the track until the bridge over the Allt na Feithe, with a small cottage visible ahead and the large, modern Glendessary Lodge beyond. Turn right immediately over the bridge onto a narrow path which heads up through the bracken. The path soon becomes clearer, passing through a gate before climbing up towards the pass. The gradient eases off at about 350 metres and there are first glimpses of Sgùrr Mòr and the neighbouring Corbett Sgùrr an Fhuarain across the pass. The path crosses numerous small streams and becomes boggy as it continues across the flat top of the pass, before fading out completely, Continue northwards down the very boggy open slope into Glen Kingie.\n\nGlen Kingie is one of the loneliest and emptiest glens in the Highlands and there is no bridge over the river in its upper reaches. It times of spate it may be impossible to cross, but in very dry weather it could be done dryshod; on the far side, aim directly uphill for the the bealach between Sgùrr Mòr and Sgùrr an Fhuarain. The pathless slope is steep at mid-height (easier slightly to the left) but the ascent is mostly grassy, but there is no doubt this is a slog. On reaching the ridge, fine views are suddenly revealed down to Loch Quoich down the far side. Sgùrr Mòr may be the main objective of this walk for many, but for only a little extra effort it is worth including Sgùrr an Fhuarain first; to do this, follow the ridge to the east. The ascent is straightforward and the summit is reached after a little over a kilometre; it is marked by a cyclindrical trig point and a neat cairn; it offers fine views, especially back along the ridge to the much grander mountain of Sgùrr Mòr .\n\nReturn along the ridge to the bealach and begin up Sgùrr Mòr . This ascent is shorter and steeper, but is aided by an old stalkers path from the days before the damming of Glen Quoich barred access from the north. The path goes off to the right of the ridge part way up and gains height in a series of delightful grassy zig-zags; this has become slightly indistinct and many walkers just plod up the ridge. There is a false summit before a final flat section leads to the large cairn marking the summit of Sgùrr Mòr . The views, over some of the wildest, most rugged country in Scotland, are fantastic, with the mountains of Knoydart in particular looking very grand. Pride of place in the view, however, goes to the sensational pointed summit of Sgùrr na Cìche.\n\nThe quickest way back is to return to the bealach and retrace the outward route, but it is possible to vary the walk by taking in a longer section of the ridge, again using the old stalkers' path. The southwest ridge of Sgùrr Mòr is very steep and rocky and would be tricky without the path, which has a series of zig-zags along grassy ledges and loses the height much more easily. After a bealach at 740 metres the path rises again to cross the subsidiary summit of Sgùrr Beag, 890 metres high, before a long descent with many more zig-zags to the lowest bealach on the ridge at 662 metres. Continue across this flat bealach and very slightly up the far side, where another stalkers path crosses the ridge; our route follows the path that runs across and gradually descends the left flank of the ridge; it is wet in places. After about 500 metres it doubles back to the left to continue the descent into Glen Kingie.\n\nThe path continues down the glen, slowly coming closer to the river. Once alongside a post and wire fence, find a convenient place to strike off, crossing the fence and the River Kingie. Contour round the often wet slopes on the far side, eventually gaining a little height to head back into the Feith a' Chicheanais pass crossed in the morning. Once through the pass pick up the path once more as it descends back into Glen Dessary and eventually meets the landrover track. Turn left to retrace your steps back to the start.",

The walk starts on the excellent constructed path up the south side of the stream. It leads past a whole series of waterfalls and beautiful pools as the stream tumbles down a small gorge. After a kilometre there is one particularly dramatic series of falls; another couple of hundred metres on (more cascades can be heard) look out for a much fainter, muddy path going off to the right up the moor. Once picked up it is clear to follow and leads past a rounded boulder before continuing up the open moor.\n\nAs the path crests a rise the gradient eases and there is a view ahead of the whole walk. Ahead is the scree-filled corrie Coir' nan Eich, edged by the steep crag of An Diallaid to the left and the Sgùrr nan Gobhar ridge to the right. Sgùrr na Banachdich is the rather shapeless (from this angle) peak set right back beyond the corrie, with pointy Sgùrr Thormaid to its immediate left. The route eventually heads up the grassy ridge to the crags of An Diallaid.\n\nThe path fades away as the burn coming down from Coir' an Eich is reached. Cross the stream, and rather than contuing up the corrie, head up the steepening grassy slopes that form a ridge leading up to An Diallaid. It stays grassy longest if you aim for the left skyline. Some walkers head up the back of Coir' an Eich instead, zigzagging up steep scree slope, but the An Diallaid route is pleasanter and slightly less steep and loose. The grass turns to stones as the climb steepens, but there are traces of a path here. The views back over Glen Brittle are superb.\n\nSoon the ridge levels off and becomes grassy again before another steeper pull up scree towards the prominent crag of An Diallaid; faint paths bypass the summit on the right. Continue across the shallow col between An Diallaid and the main bulk of the mountain. There's a sudden view from here across upper Coire a Ghreadaidh to twin summited Sgùrr a Ghreadaidh. The walk continues up the ill-defined ridge towards the summit - keep the big cliffs to your left.\n\nThe terrain here is a mix of rocks, low crags and stones but in clear weather a simple route can be found by weaving between the rocks - any obstacles can usually be passed to the right. Beyond this is a very broad rocky slope that leads up towards the summit. The main Cuillin ridge is reached suddenly, and the sheer drop down to Coir Uisg is a sensational contrast to the more gentle scree slopes you've ascended. Sgùrr na Banachdich (Smallpox peak) is a fantastic viewpoint. To the north the Cuillin ridge drops down over sharp Sgùrr Thormaid and its teeth before sweeping up again to the bulk of Sgùrr a Ghreadaidh, whilst Sgùrr nan Gillean is visible beyond.\n\nEast is the awesome void of Coir' Uisg with Loch Coruisk a jewel far below, and Bla Bheinn looking magnificent beyond.\n\nTo the south the narrow ridge sweeps on to Sgùrr Dearg; climbers can usually be seen making their way up and abseiling off the upper part of the Inaccessible Pinnacle. Beyond the In Pinn are the jagged teeth of Sgùrr Thearlach and Sgùrr Alasdair, the highest summit in the Hebrides. To their right is Glen Brittle and the Isles of Rum and Canna glittering in the sea.\n\nThe recommended return route is the same way. There is an alternative that is open only to scramblers, which is to descent the Sgùrr nan Gobhar ridge. This involves some fairly straightforward but slightly airy scrambling, with a steep scree run off the end of the ridge to the SW. Going this way would increase the walk to a Grade 5 outing.",

    "description": "The starting point of the walk is the Glen Shiel car park (not layby) on the A87 east of a gap in the forestry, there is an information board about the Glen Shiel battle and a wooden Hill Path sign. Note that this is a one-way walk and you'll need to use public transport, bike, or a lift back up the road to return to this start point. Take the path west from the car park, soon turning right to follow a boggy path steeply up the slopes to the north keeping the forestry fence on your right. This first climb of the day is barely a kilometre long, but very steep as 550 metres have to be gained to reach the Bealach an Lapain. At the corner of the forestry fence, turn left to head directly uphill on a fainter path marked with a tiny cairn. The route zigzags up the hillside above but never stops heading hard uphill until the Bealach na Lapain is reached.\n\nOnce at the bealach, relax, as the hardest part of the day is already behind. To the left (west) stretches a magnificent ridgewalk; Sgùrr Fhuaran, highest of the Five Sisters, is seen in the distance ahead, but the first climb is along the long and undulating but fine ridge to the top of Sgùrr nan Spainteach (the peak of the Spaniards). From here the descent is a little rocky, and just before the bealach there is a short rock scramble to descend. Beyond this, the ridge has two separate crests with a depression between - very confusing in misty conditions. The path heads up the right hand crest at first before switching left.\n\nAfter a steep climb the massive summit cairn of Sgùrr na Ciste Duibhe, the first Munro of the day at 1027 metres is reached; continue a short distance beyond to get a superb full length view down Loch Duich. From here, the ridge along the Five Sisters proper is broader and less well defined than that already traversed, though it is very steep, rough and bouldery. Continue down to the Bealach na Craoibhe.\n\nThe next Munro, Sgùrr na Càrnach (1002 metres) is gives very rough going, but there is a path winding up the stony slopes to the top. Sgùrr na Càrnach only became a Munro in 1997, but most Munroists had already climbed it as part of the ridge. Beyond, there is almost an identical descent to the Bealach na Càrnach, with a little very easy rocky scrambling on flakes. Beyond, the ascent to Sgùrr Fhuaran beyond is again steep and bouldery.\n\nSgùrr Fhuaran is the highest and central of the Five Sisters at 1067 metres, and the third and final Munro of the day. The west ridge of Sgùrr Fhuaran is the first reasonable descent route to Glen Shiel since the Bealach na Lapain; it gives a very long and fairly steep route down to the valley. Many walkers opt to make this descent; if doing this, continue along the valley floor. The footbridge across the river just east of Loch Shiel marked on OS maps is gone, so if following this descent it is necessary to continue along the north side until reaching the road.\n\nPurists and aesthetes, however, will want to continue the ridge walk. It is necessary to descend the west ridge for around three hundred metres to avoid steep ground; at this point, follow the path which cuts back off the west ridge and joins the north ridge. This continues to descend to reach the Bealach Buidhe. The next peak on the ridge is Sgùrr nan Saighead; this is not a Munro, and the main path bypasses the summit. It is well worth keeping to the ridge, however, as the northeast slopes of this peak are the steepest and most impressive in the whole Five Sisters range. Continue along the ridge from the summit down to the next bealach, with more great views down fearsome gulleys into Coire na h-Uaighe.\n\nAfter crossing a minor bump, the steep peak of Beinn Bhuidhe appears ahead. One path heads left here, avoiding Beinn Bhuidhe and descending its northwest ridge. If taking this option, follow the path down the ridge, descending steeply at one point beside a stream, to reach the flat bog of Fasach an t-Searraich. From here, head north and cross the Allt a Chruinn before following the path down its north bank. The other option is to scramble to the top of Beinn Buidhe, and then down its rocky NNE ridge to the next bealach. From here the purist can ascend the fifth sister, Sgùrr na Moraich, before returning to the bealach and descending to the start of the path down the north bank of the Allt a Chruinn, soon passing a waterfall. Continue down the path on the north bank, which soon improves and follows the line of a stalkers path. Lower down the hillside the stream falls into a gorge; the path swings right here before making a winding descent of the hillside. It passes through a gate lower down, and emerges into Allt a'chruinn village beside the waterworks. You are now about 13 kilometres from where you began the walk.",

At the next junction ignore the turning where the Tomdoun route heads off up to the right and keep on the main route, which runs close to the River Dessary and then leads past Glendessary Farm and the gateway to the modern Glendessary Lodge, before continuing to Upper Glendessary.\n\nTurn right onto a footpath just before Upper Glendessary, signed for Inverie.

Eventually it eases at a shoulder at around 800m, then rises again to a minor top before the final ridge which gives a pleasant traverse to the summit of Sgùrr nan Coireachan at 953m - the first Munro of the day, with a great outlook along Loch Quoich.\n\nThere's an even more wonderful panorama of the more rugged mountains along the ridge ahead. From here, the descent is very steep in places; it heads down to the west and then southwest to reach the Bealach Coire nan Gall. There are a few old fenceposts on the way down. From the bealach, the first steep section of the climb beyond is tackled to the left of a drystone dyke.\n\nContinue on the path, often accompanied by the wall (though this relents at some rockier section). The route climbs steeply and then begins a traverse of Garbh Chioch Bheag to reach the larger Garbh Chioch Mhor. The going is exceptionally rough with many steep ascents and descents and twists and turns to avoid rocky obstacles. It will probably take longer than expected to reach the cairn on this second Munro. The views along the ridge, particularly down into the corrie on the north, are as wild and rugged as anywhere in Scotland.\n\nContinue following the wall down steeply down to the bealach below the impressive final cone of Sgùrr na Cìche. The bealach is known as 'Feadan na Cìche' - the whistle of the breast (after its parent peak), and the wind can certainly tear through here. The ascent ahead looks formidable with much rock but there is a path which winds its way to the left at first before cutting back in zigzags towards the summit.\n\nSgùrr na Cìche's cone is the third and highest of the day's Munros and one of the shapeliest summits in Britain, though the summit area is larger and grassier than expected. It is one of those mountains that is easily identified in distant views; now you've managed to climb, it gives a magnificent view down the length of Loch Nevis. Return to the last bealach before descending to the southwest.\n\nThe way soon leads down into a gorge-like ravine; this part of the descent is steep and requires minor scrambling - and great care. Further down the gully opens out once more; continue down to below the steepest ground before bearing left (southeast) across a shoulder of Garbh Chioch Mhor. The path - faint in places - then descends more steeply again, eventually meeting a rough ATV track. Turn left down this, eventually it meets the path path from Sourlies at the head of Loch Nevis to Glendessary. Turn left along this path to continue down the glen.\n\nBefore reaching the forestry there's a choice of routes; the old stalking path keeps left just above the trees to eventually rejoin the outward route. Alternatively you can aim towards the stile that leads into trees in the glen floor. Once in the forest a rough track reaches and then follows the River Dessary, later crossing it at an old bridge. On the far side the track gives much better going, eventually emerging into a more open section. Continue on the track into the next block of forestry. A' Chùil Bothy is just off to the north of the track where it enters the trees; if visiting, follow the bothy code. Continue through the forest for another four kilometres to a junction with another track; turn left here to cross the river at Strathan and return to the start. If you have to drive back out along Loch Arkaig, take great care as you are certain to be exhausted.",

    "description": "The starting point of the walk is the Glen Shiel car park (not layby) on the A87 east of a gap in the forestry, there is an information board about the Glen Shiel battle and a wooden Hill Path sign. Note that this is a one-way walk and you'll need to use public transport, bike, or a lift back up the road to return to this start point. Take the path west from the car park, soon turning right to follow a boggy path steeply up the slopes to the north keeping the forestry fence on your right. This first climb of the day is barely a kilometre long, but very steep as 550 metres have to be gained to reach the Bealach an Lapain. At the corner of the forestry fence, turn left to head directly uphill on a fainter path marked with a tiny cairn. The route zigzags up the hillside above but never stops heading hard uphill until the Bealach na Lapain is reached.\n\nOnce at the bealach, relax, as the hardest part of the day is already behind. To the left (west) stretches a magnificent ridgewalk; Sgùrr Fhuaran, highest of the Five Sisters, is seen in the distance ahead, but the first climb is along the long and undulating but fine ridge to the top of Sgùrr nan Spainteach (the peak of the Spaniards). From here the descent is a little rocky, and just before the bealach there is a short rock scramble to descend. Beyond this, the ridge has two separate crests with a depression between - very confusing in misty conditions. The path heads up the right hand crest at first before switching left.\n\nAfter a steep climb the massive summit cairn of Sgùrr na Ciste Duibhe, the first Munro of the day at 1027 metres is reached; continue a short distance beyond to get a superb full length view down Loch Duich. From here, the ridge along the Five Sisters proper is broader and less well defined than that already traversed, though it is very steep, rough and bouldery. Continue down to the Bealach na Craoibhe.\n\nThe next Munro, Sgùrr na Càrnach (1002 metres) is gives very rough going, but there is a path winding up the stony slopes to the top. Sgùrr na Càrnach only became a Munro in 1997, but most Munroists had already climbed it as part of the ridge. Beyond, there is almost an identical descent to the Bealach na Càrnach, with a little very easy rocky scrambling on flakes. Beyond, the ascent to Sgùrr Fhuaran beyond is again steep and bouldery.\n\nSgùrr Fhuaran is the highest and central of the Five Sisters at 1067 metres, and the third and final Munro of the day. The west ridge of Sgùrr Fhuaran is the first reasonable descent route to Glen Shiel since the Bealach na Lapain; it gives a very long and fairly steep route down to the valley. Many walkers opt to make this descent; if doing this, continue along the valley floor. The footbridge across the river just east of Loch Shiel marked on OS maps is gone, so if following this descent it is necessary to continue along the north side until reaching the road.\n\nPurists and aesthetes, however, will want to continue the ridge walk. It is necessary to descend the west ridge for around three hundred metres to avoid steep ground; at this point, follow the path which cuts back off the west ridge and joins the north ridge. This continues to descend to reach the Bealach Buidhe. The next peak on the ridge is Sgùrr nan Saighead; this is not a Munro, and the main path bypasses the summit. It is well worth keeping to the ridge, however, as the northeast slopes of this peak are the steepest and most impressive in the whole Five Sisters range. Continue along the ridge from the summit down to the next bealach, with more great views down fearsome gulleys into Coire na h-Uaighe.\n\nAfter crossing a minor bump, the steep peak of Beinn Bhuidhe appears ahead. One path heads left here, avoiding Beinn Bhuidhe and descending its northwest ridge. If taking this option, follow the path down the ridge, descending steeply at one point beside a stream, to reach the flat bog of Fasach an t-Searraich. From here, head north and cross the Allt a Chruinn before following the path down its north bank. The other option is to scramble to the top of Beinn Buidhe, and then down its rocky NNE ridge to the next bealach. From here the purist can ascend the fifth sister, Sgùrr na Moraich, before returning to the bealach and descending to the start of the path down the north bank of the Allt a Chruinn, soon passing a waterfall. Continue down the path on the north bank, which soon improves and follows the line of a stalkers path. Lower down the hillside the stream falls into a gorge; the path swings right here before making a winding descent of the hillside. It passes through a gate lower down, and emerges into Allt a'chruinn village beside the waterworks. You are now about 13 kilometres from where you began the walk.",

    "description": "Take the minor road leading to the north end of the Loch Mullardoch dam. There is only very limited parking just beyond the dam; there is more space part way up the dam road on the right. Go through the gate at the end of the road and follow the track beyond, keeping above the ugly tide mark of the reservoir. The monument on the left commemorates the 'Chisholm stone' - the traditional gathering place of the glen - now submerged beneath the waters of the loch. The track has been improved for a hydro scheme - follow it on an undulating course to reach a hydro powerhouse and then cross the dilapidated bridge over the Allt Mullardoch beyond. On the far side leave the track to head directly northwest towards Mullach na Maoile.\n\nThe climb soon becomes steep up a slope of heather and bracken; the easiest line is between two tiny streambeds. From the flat top of the Mullach na Maoile, there is a slight dip before the final long stony rise to Càrn nan Gobhar, the first Munro of the day. There are two summits, the first with a very well-built cairn, whilst the second is the true summit, across a slight depression. The best views are to the west, looking across to the lochans, corries and ridges of Sgùrr na Lapaich.\n\nDescend the stone ridge to the Bealach na Cloiche Duibhe (Pass of the Black Rock). Sgùrr na Lapaich can look intimidating from here; the route of ascent is up the facing ridge, grassy lower down but rocky high up. Follow the narrow path up it; this keeps just to the left of the true ridge line, at one point following a strange lateral grassy ridge caused by a landslip; the ascent does cross a few short sections of boulders but avoids any scrambling. The ridge ends right by the summit, marked by a large wind-shelter cairn containing a trig point. The view is both extensive and dramatic, particularly back across the cliffs to Loch Tuill Bhearnach, whilst the next objective, the great ridged mountain of An Riabhachan, looks impressive to the west. Descend the fairly grassy ridge southwest to the Bealach Toll an Lochain.\n\nThe bealach is a low one at 820 metres so the re-ascent to An Riabhachan is considerable. A path leads up the first broad slope. This leads up to a fine, narrow grassy ridge that makes for a delightful ascent. The views back of the steep, broken slopes of Sgùrr na Lapaich towering over Loch Mòr are very impressive, whilst the ridge itself maintains interest in the route ahead. The climb ends when the ridge levels out at 1120 metres. It now widens but is grassy and the almost level walk along to the summit cairn of An Riabhachan is easy and enjoyable if the weather is good.\n\nThe well-built summit cairn has very steep slopes dropping down to the left and a glimpse of Loch Mullardoch, with the Càrn Eige range beyond it, but it is to the north that the view excels. Most of Loch Monar can be seen (rather spoiled by the water extraction tide-mark around it) whilst beyond and to the northwest rise a fantastic array of peaks stretching away into Torridon. Continue along the almost level ridge to the cairned summit at 1080 metres where the main ridge turns sharply left. Follow the path that continues west, soon descending very steeply to a lower section of ridge. The next section of this ridge is very narrow but easy enough; it then climbs slightly to a minor summit (which can be avoided on the left).\n\nThe ridge now descends southwest, the path on the crest avoiding the slabby blocks off to the right. There is then a second steep section of descent (easy scrambling) to reach the Bealach a'Bholla. An Socach looks impressive from here, the east top appearing as a steep pyramid crowning the ridge ahead (and giving the mountain its name). Follow the path directly up the ridge; there is one rocky step on the path but this can be easily avoided to the right. From the east top the ridge leads easily on to the main summit with a tumbledown windshelter cairn housing a trig point. An Socach is one of the remotest Munros in Scotland and its central position in the Northwest Highlands makes it a fabulous viewpoint. The coast and Skye look close in good visibility, whilst Torridon and the Monar peaks look fabulous. Nearer at hand there are good views across the dramatic eastern corrie towards Loch Mullardoch.\n\nFor the descent, follow the ridge along the edge of the corrie. After a couple of kilometres the descent steepens before reaching the start of the flat ridge stretching east to Meall Bac a' Chul-dhoire. This final section of ridge is riven by eroded peat hags and rather than continue across them at, it is probably best to bear left across the bogs to reach the nearby Allt Coire a' Mhaim. Cross this to pick up faint path down the far side. The path soon improves (though boggy in places) and leads down past several attractive waterfalls to approach close to the shores of Loch Mullardoch. Cross the Allt Socrach bridge on the left before following an initially faint path right almost to the tide-mark.\n\nYou are now faced with a very long and tiring walk back to the start. The path improves as it traverses across the very steep grassy slopes which plunge down to the loch. At several points care is needed as the drop onto the stony tide-mark is steep and the path is eroded in parts. After almost four kilometres of this undulating path the slope eases; the path now fades out. A kilometre further the foot of the Allt Taige is reached. There is no bridge over this stream and it could be a dangerous trap if the water is high (if in doubt, you should reverse the route so as to cross the Taige early in the day). The easiest place to cross is usually just above the outflow into the loch. On the far side, continue above the loch to reach a pinewood; pass just above this and continue traversing to reach the bridge over the Allt Mullardoch crossed earlier in the day. Now you simply have to follow the undulating, muddy track back to the start.",

    "description": "The road up Glen Strathfarrar is private and vehicular access is strictly controlled at the locked gate at Milton Cottage near Struy and a maximum number of 25 cars allowed in a day. In the summer months the gate is open from 9am to between 6 - 8pm depending on the month; it is closed all day Tuesday and until 1.30pm on Wednesdays. In the winter access must be arranged in advance through Mountaineering Scotland. See their page on Strathfarrar access for further details. There are no access restrictions for walkers or cyclists and there is a car park near Milton Cottage. To start this walk, drive along the Glen until a flat grassy area between Loch Beannacharan and Loch a' Mhuillidh is reached. Here a track heads north and there is parking on the grass just off the track. Follow the track uphill.\n\nContinue on the track past the small dam on the stream and continue uphill. Where a small path branches off to the left, continue for a very short while on the faint track and follow a clearer path to the left - they both eventually join up as they follow the Allt Coire Mhuillidh upstream. At this point the second Munro of the day, Càrn nan Gobhar can be seen straight ahead, a rather insignificant looking grassy dome, and the first summit, Sgùrr na Ruaidhe, slightly to the right looks very easy, but much of the ascent cannot be seen from this angle. After crossing the first side stream, climb up the easy grassy slope in a north east direction - there is a faint path but at times this is indistinct and boggy.\n\nBefore you reach the top, a stone shelter is reached and then the summit cairn a little further on at 993m. The walk to the Bealach nam Botaichean in a north, west north direction is on lovely spongy moss and grass which is very easy going. There is a small steep section to the actual col and then a long and straightforward pull up first north north west and then as the steepness eases, westwards, to the summit of Càrn nan Gobhar. The last few metres are covered in boulders and there is a small cairn at the north edge at 992 metres where there is a good view of the route up Sgùrr a'Choire Ghlais.\n\nFrom the cairn, retrace your steps along the ridge south over the boulders a short way and then follow the pleasant grassy ridge southwards and then south west as it steepens to Bealach Sneachda at 865m. The steep pull up the other side is straightforward with a small path and a boulder section near the top. There is are two large cairns on the summit (1083m) and a trig point in between. There are good views north to Glen Orrin, Strathconon and to the Fannichs beyond. From the northern cairn, you can descend the rocky ridge or bypass the boulders by heading west from the trig point and then heading back north to the ridge to continue north west along the clear ridge.\n\nThe descent to Bealach Toll Sgaile is straightforward and as the ridge narrows and the views of Creag Ghorm a'Bhealaich improve makes an impressive section of the walk. On the ascent the summit of Creag Ghorm a'Bhealaich can be bypassed but the tiny detour to the top is worth it for the dramatic views down into the coire. From here there is only a small descent before the final pull to the summit of Sgùrr Fhuar-thuill at 1049m.\n\nFrom the summit continue west, just beyond the col at 987m a stalkers path leaves the ridge to the south west - a small cairn marks the spot. From here there are great views across to the slabby face of Sgùrr na Muice with Loch Toll a' Mhuic below. Follow the clear path as it descends steeply at first and then traverses below the ridge and descends to the eastern side of the Loch. Keep following the path until it crosses the stream and later becomes a track and follows the course of the Allt Toll a' Mhuic downhill with some impressive waterfalls and pleasant birchwoods. Eventually the track emerges onto the Glen Strathfarrar road. Turn left here and follow the road for the 6km to return to the start, passing Braulen Lodge on the way.",

Cross the road (carefully) and walk east along it until reaching the foot of the stalkers path leading up to the col between Biod an Fhithich and Meallan Odhar. This excellent path winds two and fro up the hillside before making a long traverse to reach the col.\n\nFrom the col, turn left. The path traverses to the right hand side of the summit of Meallan Odhar, reaching the ridge once more between that peak and the foot of the Forcan ridge. When the path begins to climb steeply towards the first rocky steps, a choice must be made as regards whether to tackle the Forcan ridge or avoid it. If avoiding the ridge, turn left here and contour the slope, keeping just to the right of a drystone dyke; this leads up to the Bealach Coire Mhalagain. Otherwise, continue on the main path directly up to the Forcan Ridge.\n\nThe scrambling is simple at first, but the ridge becomes progressively more exposed. Some sections are a real knife-edge, but there is a worn scrambling path which avoids the rocks by keeping just to the right at several points. The exposure is however considerable. After passing the top of Sgùrr na Forcan there is an awkward steep descent of a pitch of about 10 metres; this can be avoided using a gully to the left or a rake to the right. Beyond this the ridge leads over a minor top to ridge the summit of the Saddle, at 1010 metres. The trig point is slightly further along the ridge\n\nTo descend to Bealach Coire Mhalagain, head a short distance south of the trig point to where a path can be seen beginning to make the descent. It winds clearly and steeply at first before petering out in the boulder fields further down. Beyond the boulder fields a boggy traverse eastwards leads to the Bealach. If you have reached here by the drystone dyke, avoiding the Forcan Ridge, use the descent route just described to reach the summit of the Saddle.\n\nTo continue to Sgùrr na Sgìne, there is a sketchy path which winds up the rocky slopes beyond. It is a stiff climb, but you should reach the ridge without too much difficulty. Turn south along the ridge, easily reaching the northwest top of Sgùrr na Sgìne. From here, the ridge becomes very rocky on the continuation to the main summit which is perched above a steep face at 946 metres; the second Munro of the day.\n\nReturn over the northwest top and continue along the ridge to its elegant termination at the minor summit of Faochag. This peak has a dramatic outline when seen from higher up Glen Shiel. The descent is directly down the northeast ridge, which looks impossible from some viewpoints. Closer inspection reveals that - although unremittingly steep - there is a rough, often wet path that aids the tiring descent the whole way down to the glen, with views of the great wall of the Five Sisters opposite. Cross the Allt Mhalagain at the foot of the ridge (or continue on the west bank if this is impossible) and walk up to the road. You are now only about half a kilometre from the layby and the start.",

    "description": "The start of this walk is from Alltbeithe (also known as Glen Affric YHA), the remotest hostel in Britain. Allbeithe can only be reached on foot, and an overnight stop in the hostel, camping or at Camban bothy prior to this walk will be essential for most. The shortest approach is via the An Caorannmor from the Cluanie Inn. Far better approaches are by walking in from Glen Affric, or either of the two halves described in this circular route from Morvich, Kintail. To begin the walk from the hostel, take the path which leads out the back passing the separate dormitory building and the water supply.\n\nThe route bends to the right and crosses the Allt Beithe Min, and then the Allt na Faing. Just beyond this latter stream, the excellently constructed path passes through a gate in the deer fence and begins to climb, keeping to the east side of the stream. A good view back of the Alltbeithe hostel opens up as height is gained; further up the mountainside, a second deer fence is reached at another gate. Continue up the path; further on the surface deteriorates and the going becomes boggier as Coire na Cloiche is reached. Continue on the soggy path which climbs more gently up to the bealach (pass) at about 790 metres, with a view down the far side into desolate Gleann a'Choilich.\n\nFrom here, you need the decide which of the three peaks to tackle first. It seems a good idea to make it Mullach na Dheiragain, the remotest peak - Sgùrr na Ceathreamhnan can be bypassed on the route out and climbed on the way back. To do this, do not descend north from the bealach but head west along the ridge for about two hundred metres first. At this point what looks at first like a small stream bed leads northwest off the ridge, leading to traces of a path descending fairly steeply northwest. Once down to the 750 metre contour, turn west heading for the outflow at the bottom of the Loch Coire nan Dearcag lochans. These lochans are set in a grand, remote corrie, backed by crags. Crossing the boggy area below them is relatively straightforward; now head northwest up straightforward slopes to reach the Bealach nan Daoine.\n\nAt the pass you will meet a path along the ridge; turn right along it. It climbs up towards the Top of Càrn na Con Dhu. The summit area of this peak can be confusing in mist are there are various knobbly undulations. Towards the northeast end, a short boulder field is crossed and after that the ridge narrows, with steep slopes on the right, and the way is clearer, descending in two sections to reach the Bealach na Con Dhu. Continue along the ridge, heading up the wide and sprawling slopes of Mullach na Dheiragain. The path seems to wander off left rather than ascending, so strike out directly up the slope to locate the summit cairn towards the far end. Mullach na Dheiragain is a Munro at 982 metres, and is one of the least accessible of all Britain's peaks. Reaching it from and returning to any roadside starting point inside a day is a feat for supermen only, so its summit is a real prize, even if the summit area lacks distinction.\n\nReturn back down the ridge, crossing the Bealach na Con Dhu and Càrn na Con Dhu, to return to the Bealach nan Daoine. This time, continue along the ridge as it ascends once more. As height is gained the ridge narrows and steepens to give a fine route directly to the summit cairn of Sgùrr nan Ceathreamhnan. This is the highest Munro in the immediate area, at 1151 metres, and is at the apex of several ridges as well as being a very extensive viewpoint.\n\nThe summit ridge leading west from the cairn is narrow and dramatic, but the continuation of our walk is to descend the southeast ridge. This descends continuously at first before turning east and crossing several undulations and minor summits before reaching the bealach reached earlier, at the top of the path up from Alltbeithe.\n\nBefore descending back to Alltbeithe, it is straightforward to include the third Munro of An Socach in the itinerary. Continue east from the bealach, climbing briefly before crossing a flat area with several lochans. The dome of An Socach looms just beyond, and is easily ascended following the path.\n\nThe summit cairn is 921 metres, making it the smallest of the three summits. Return to the bealach, and then retrace the path back down to Alltbeithe via the Allt na Faing.",

From the parking area walk back along the road for 20 metres until you reach the track leading to Loch a Bhraoin; it is signed for long distance routes to Kinlochewe and Loch Fannich. Go past the barrier and along the track, with views of the mountains ahead. Soon a gate is reached and new paths head off to the left and right - turn left here, following a path which leads through the forestry and then down to a bridge over the outflow of the loch. Meall a' Chrasgaigh and Sgùrr nan Clach Geala are both in clear view from here. Once across this bridge, follow the stalkers path for about 30m before turning off on a smaller, boggy ATV track.\n\nThis leads to a bridge over the Allt Breabaig which isn't marked on the OS maps, and avoids the possibility of having a difficult crossing of the Allt Breabaig. Once across the bridge continue along the very boggy ATV track, which heads S and then SE; you may spot the old stalkers path coming up from the ford. After just over a kilometre from the bridge choose a good place to leave the ATV trod and strike off directly up the steep slopes towards Meall a' Chrasgaidh. There is no path and the ascent is arduous, but there are soon fine views back towards An Teallach and the western Fannichs peaks.\n\nHigher up the slope eases considerably for the final kilometre to the summit of Meall a'Chrasgaidh. The cairn here is at 934m, but the peak is rather overshadowed by the much higher peaks of Sgùrr Mòr to the southeast and Sgùrr nan Clach Geala to the south; it is one of the less distinguished of the Fannichs' Munros.\n\nHead south from the summit to the bealach and then make a rising traverse to the lochan on the bealach between Càrn na Criche and Sgùrr nan Clach Geala. This is known as 'Am Biachdaich - meaning the place of the fattening, due to its fine grasses; the waters of the lochan often reflect the elegant domed peak of Sgùrr Mòr.\n\nFrom the col, climb the slope beyond. This is fairly broad at first but soon narrows to a fine ridge, one of the most enjoyable section of the day. There are huge sweeping crags to the left as the fine ridge curves round over several undulations before finally reaching the trig point on the summit of Sgùrr nan Clach Geala.\n\nThis has a magnificent situation with a great feeling of space all around. The walk continues down the broader south ridge (still with steep crags on the left), which leads downhill for a long way to reach the pass at Cadha na Guite.\n\nTo reach the third Munro of the day, continue up the ridge beyond. It curves gracefully first to the right and then to the left, giving a fine traverse to the summit of Sgùrr nan Each. The highest cairn is at the far end of the little ridge at 922 metres.\n\nReturn to Cadha na Guite, and then descend the steep western slopes. There is no path at first, but eventually a rough one can be picked up that descends diagonally across the slopes to the right - crossing a patch of scree and becoming very boggy lower down. Aim to reach the col at the head of the Allt Breabaig valley, which requires careful navigation in mist, avoiding a descent too far into Fliuch Choire.\n\nThe col here is very boggy as is the first part of the descent to the north; try to pick up the top of the stalkers path - just the far side of the valley floor - as soon as you can, as it gives a better chance of dry feet. Continue down this improving path, which soon crosses back to the east bank of the stream. After crossing several smaller burns (the Allt Daimh Mor could be a problem in high spate) it comes close to outward route. You can either continue down the stalkers path all the way to the ford of the Allt Breabaig and then continue down past some beautiful pools, or if the burn is high head for bridge used by the ATV track earlier in the day. Either way, return to the bridge at the outflow of Loch a'Bhraoin and reverse the outward route to return to the start.",

    "description": "The seemingless endless drive along the roller-coaster minor road along Loch Arkaig ends where the public road terminates close to the head of the loch. There is a new car park here. Follow the track that is the continuation of the road, forking right at the junction, signed for Tomdoun and Morar. At the next junction ignore the turning where the Tomdoun route heads off up to the right and keep on the main route, which runs close to the River Dessary and then leads past Glendessary Farm and the gateway to the modern Glendessary Lodge, before continuing to Upper Glendessary.\n\nTurn right onto a footpath just before Upper Glendessary, signed for Inverie. After just a few metres the path turns left, and runs across the hillside towards the top corner of the forestry. This historic route then traverses the hills just above the trees. The way crosses some small burns and can be boggy in places. Continue on the path to reach the larger Allt Coire nan Uth. The path crosses this some way above the forest (in spate conditions, there's a bridge at the top of the forestry). Once across, bear off to the right, where a small cairn indicates the start of a path which climbs up the steep slopes which become the south ridge of Sgùrr nan Coireachan.\n\nThe climb is mostly on very steep grass interspersed with rocks; it seems to get ever steeper as height is gained. Eventually it eases at a shoulder at around 800m, then rises again to a minor top before the final ridge which gives a pleasant traverse to the summit of Sgùrr nan Coireachan at 953m - the first Munro of the day, with a great outlook along Loch Quoich.\n\nThere's an even more wonderful panorama of the more rugged mountains along the ridge ahead. From here, the descent is very steep in places; it heads down to the west and then southwest to reach the Bealach Coire nan Gall. There are a few old fenceposts on the way down. From the bealach, the first steep section of the climb beyond is tackled to the left of a drystone dyke.\n\nContinue on the path, often accompanied by the wall (though this relents at some rockier section). The route climbs steeply and then begins a traverse of Garbh Chioch Bheag to reach the larger Garbh Chioch Mhor. The going is exceptionally rough with many steep ascents and descents and twists and turns to avoid rocky obstacles. It will probably take longer than expected to reach the cairn on this second Munro. The views along the ridge, particularly down into the corrie on the north, are as wild and rugged as anywhere in Scotland.\n\nContinue following the wall down steeply down to the bealach below the impressive final cone of Sgùrr na Cìche. The bealach is known as 'Feadan na Cìche' - the whistle of the breast (after its parent peak), and the wind can certainly tear through here. The ascent ahead looks formidable with much rock but there is a path which winds its way to the left at first before cutting back in zigzags towards the summit.\n\nSgùrr na Cìche's cone is the third and highest of the day's Munros and one of the shapeliest summits in Britain, though the summit area is larger and grassier than expected. It is one of those mountains that is easily identified in distant views; now you've managed to climb, it gives a magnificent view down the length of Loch Nevis. Return to the last bealach before descending to the southwest.\n\nThe way soon leads down into a gorge-like ravine; this part of the descent is steep and requires minor scrambling - and great care. Further down the gully opens out once more; continue down to below the steepest ground before bearing left (southeast) across a shoulder of Garbh Chioch Mhor. The path - faint in places - then descends more steeply again, eventually meeting a rough ATV track. Turn left down this, eventually it meets the path path from Sourlies at the head of Loch Nevis to Glendessary. Turn left along this path to continue down the glen.\n\nBefore reaching the forestry there's a choice of routes; the old stalking path keeps left just above the trees to eventually rejoin the outward route. Alternatively you can aim towards the stile that leads into trees in the glen floor. Once in the forest a rough track reaches and then follows the River Dessary, later crossing it at an old bridge. On the far side the track gives much better going, eventually emerging into a more open section. Continue on the track into the next block of forestry. A' Chùil Bothy is just off to the north of the track where it enters the trees; if visiting, follow the bothy code. Continue through the forest for another four kilometres to a junction with another track; turn left here to cross the river at Strathan and return to the start. If you have to drive back out along Loch Arkaig, take great care as you are certain to be exhausted.",

The impressive monument seen across the other side of the road is worth a visit - it commemorates where Bonnie Prince Charlie first raised his standard at the start of the 1745 Jacobite uprising. Start by taking the path up the glen from the car park. It crosses a footbridge and then continues upriver, before eventually meeting a private tarmac road at the foot of the Glenfinnan Viaduct, part of the famous West Highland railway. The Viaduct has become even better known in recent years after it starred in the Harry Potter movies. Turn right along the lane to head under the viaduct.\n\nContinue up the tarmac road beyond, ignoring the turning off to the right over the river. The road runs up the glen, with forestry clothing the hills on both sides. After another three kilometres it crosses a bridge over the Allt a Chaol-ghlinne. Over the bridge turn off the tarmac at a junction onto the rougher track to the right signed Loch Arkaig and Bothy. This soon reaches the old cottage of Corryhully. This is maintained by the estate as an open bothy for use by walkers outside the stalking season. Continue on the track up the west bank of the River Finnan for another couple of kilometres, passing the signed path for Sgùrr nan Coireachan (marked with a cairn this is the return route), keep straight ahead when a track heads down to the right and pass a waterfall on stepping stones.\n\nNear a hydro power intake bear left on the track to cross a bridge. Cross this and continue uphill on the track until you have passed a small area of trees over to your left. A short distance after this, turn left off the track (there are traces of a path and a small sign for Sgurr Thuilm) and head up towards the Druim Coire a'Bheithe ridge. The going is boggy at first; later the path becomes clearer and climbs the steepest section just to the right of a burn. The slope eases above the 600 metre contour; continue uphill on the now grassy ridge, with great views back down the glen.\n\nSgùrr Thuilm is now in view ahead. The ridge curves left and crosses a minor bump, briefly joining a line of fenceposts. The fenceposts are left behind for the final ascent to the summit. The ridge is fairly wide but there are very steep drops off either side. The cairn at 963m is the highest of the day's two Munros, with great views towards Knoydart and down to Loch Arkaig.\n\nRetrace your steps back down the last part of the ascent, returning as far as the fenceposts and then bearing right to follow these onto the knobbly ridge which leads to Sgùrr nan Coireachan. There are several rocky bumps along the ridge, but there's now a fairly worn path that can soon be picked up and is a great help with traversing them all. After crossing the first bump, there's a longer descent to the lowest point on the ridge.\n\nThe second bump is fairly minor, with only a slight descent before the climb to the third bump - Beinn Gharbh. The going is now becoming much rockier, and there's a small lochan and a great view back along the ridge to Sgùrr Thuilm. Continue towards the fourth bump - Meall an Tarmachan. This has a steep nose which can be passed on either side.\n\nAfter a very brief descent the final ascent towards Sgùrr nan Coireachan begins; there's a great view towards the wild head of Loch Morar to the right of the summit. Continue up to reach the cylindrical trig point at 956m marking the second Munro of the day. Although lower than Sgùrr Thuilm it is a better summit and a finer viewpoint.\n\nFrom here descend the broad southeast ridge. There are several bumps before a slight rise to the minor peak of Sgùrr a Choire Riabhaich. Just beyond this the ridge drops very steeply in slopes of grass and broken rock; follow the path which swings to the right when this drop is reached, making an eroded descent before it cuts back across the slope to rejoin the ridge below the steep section.\n\nContinue down a more sedate section of ridge before the ground steepens once more. This time the slope is less forbidding and the path continues down the ridge without difficulty. Further down the ridge starts to become very rocky. Eventually you'll reach the start of a well-graded stalkers path that descends to the left in a series of zig-zags before heading diagonally down the east flank of the ridge. This path leads back to the track used earlier; turn right to return to Corryhully and then continue all the way back to Glenfinnan.",

    "description": "There is a large rough parking area off the south side of the A87 at Lundie (there are no buildings). These mountains are very foreshortened from here, only really appearing full height from much further down towards Glen Moriston. Start the walk by crossing the current A87 road and walking up an old section of the main road on the other side. After a short distance, turn left up a worn, stony track, signed for Càrn Ghluasaid. This follows the line of the old military road and heads up - with good views back - and through a gate before climbing to the right of a transmitter mast. Just beyond this it forks; the old military road contours the hillside, but our route follows the now more obvious hill path to the right, climbing the hillside.\n\nThis old stalkers path used for the ascent is a real delight, being well-graded and mostly dry underfoot. It climbs up to reach a flatter shoulder at An Cruachan, and later crosses some large rocky slabs across which the route is marked with rocks. Further on the path begins climbing again, tackling the steep slope on the left of Coire nan Clach in a series of sharp zigzags. Above this section the west ridge of Càrn Ghluasaid is joined and is enjoyable to follow. Eventually a flattish, bouldery plateau is reached.\n\nThere is a tiny cairn marking the highest point of Càrn Ghluasaid, but another cairn a few metres away has the finest position, situated on the northern edge of the plateau with steep cliffs falling immediately beyond. This rather insignificant summit is a Munro. Continue the walk, keeping the impressive cliffs of the corrie on your right. There is only a short descent before a longer climb leads up to the top of Creag a'Chaorainn; the path veers left to bypass the summit of this minor top.\n\nThere is a very slight descent to the very stony Creag Bealach before the ridge turns towards the north and climbs much more steeply towards the quite graceful summit dome of Sgùrr nan Conbhairean.\n\nThis massive Munro has a suitably large summit cairn and is one of the giants of the area at 1110 metres. It gives very extensive views, particularly impressive looking east over the corries. Go northwest for a short distance, still keeping the steeper cliffs on your right.\n\nFollow the now well defined ridge northwards, with grand views down to the crags and corries to the right, and the regenerating forest of Gleann na Cìche to the left. Once at the bealach, there is only short rise to the first and seemingly insignificant summit of Sàil Chaorainn; though a minor bump this is the third Munro of the day at 1002 metres, just a metre higher than the remoter north top. Return to the bealach below Sgùrr nan Conbhairean. It isn't necessary to climb all the way back over the summit; at the foot of the summit cone a small cairn marks a path which traverses below the summit to the west.\n\nDescend the southwest ridge, which is initially broad but soon narrows to a fine arête with the Gorm Lochan down to the left and Toll Easach to the right. The ridge rises ahead to Drochaid an Tuill Easaich; it isn't necessary to head right up to this summit as a path cuts across its left flank to gain its south ridge.\n\nHead along this ridge, making an initially excellent descent, with good views of Coire Làir on the left. Much lower down the ridge becomes indistinct around Meall Breac; descend southeast and then east down rough, tussocky and in places steep ground towards the Allt Coire nan Clach. If possible cross this burn above its ravine to pick up traces of a path down the east side.\n\nThe path improves as descent continues down to the line of old Military road, reached at a gate. A path ahead continues down to the busy main road ahead, but this can be avoided by instead turning left along the line of the old Military Road, now a faint path follow a line of old fenceposts. This climbs slightly and rejoins the outward route at the fork above the transmitter mast. Continue ahead to return to the start.",

From the parking area walk back along the road for 20 metres until you reach the track leading to Loch a Bhraoin; it is signed for long distance routes to Kinlochewe and Loch Fannich. Go past the barrier and along the track, with views of the mountains ahead. Soon a gate is reached and new paths head off to the left and right - turn left here, following a path which leads through the forestry and then down to a bridge over the outflow of the loch. Meall a' Chrasgaigh and Sgùrr nan Clach Geala are both in clear view from here. Once across this bridge, follow the stalkers path for about 30m before turning off on a smaller, boggy ATV track.\n\nThis leads to a bridge over the Allt Breabaig which isn't marked on the OS maps, and avoids the possibility of having a difficult crossing of the Allt Breabaig. Once across the bridge continue along the very boggy ATV track, which heads S and then SE; you may spot the old stalkers path coming up from the ford. After just over a kilometre from the bridge choose a good place to leave the ATV trod and strike off directly up the steep slopes towards Meall a' Chrasgaidh. There is no path and the ascent is arduous, but there are soon fine views back towards An Teallach and the western Fannichs peaks.\n\nHigher up the slope eases considerably for the final kilometre to the summit of Meall a'Chrasgaidh. The cairn here is at 934m, but the peak is rather overshadowed by the much higher peaks of Sgùrr Mòr to the southeast and Sgùrr nan Clach Geala to the south; it is one of the less distinguished of the Fannichs' Munros.\n\nHead south from the summit to the bealach and then make a rising traverse to the lochan on the bealach between Càrn na Criche and Sgùrr nan Clach Geala. This is known as 'Am Biachdaich - meaning the place of the fattening, due to its fine grasses; the waters of the lochan often reflect the elegant domed peak of Sgùrr Mòr.\n\nFrom the col, climb the slope beyond. This is fairly broad at first but soon narrows to a fine ridge, one of the most enjoyable section of the day. There are huge sweeping crags to the left as the fine ridge curves round over several undulations before finally reaching the trig point on the summit of Sgùrr nan Clach Geala.\n\nThis has a magnificent situation with a great feeling of space all around. The walk continues down the broader south ridge (still with steep crags on the left), which leads downhill for a long way to reach the pass at Cadha na Guite.\n\nTo reach the third Munro of the day, continue up the ridge beyond. It curves gracefully first to the right and then to the left, giving a fine traverse to the summit of Sgùrr nan Each. The highest cairn is at the far end of the little ridge at 922 metres.\n\nReturn to Cadha na Guite, and then descend the steep western slopes. There is no path at first, but eventually a rough one can be picked up that descends diagonally across the slopes to the right - crossing a patch of scree and becoming very boggy lower down.

Either way, return to the bridge at the outflow of Loch a'Bhraoin and reverse the outward route to return to the start.",

    "description": "Park just before the campsite at the end of the Glen Brittle road. The walk starts up the prominent path just left of the campsite toilet block. The early part of the route was once an eroded swamp, but following extensive works there is now an excellent pitched-stone constructed footpath. Go straight across at a rough track, then higher up turn right at a fork onto the path for Coire Ghrunnda, soon crossing a burn.\n\nThe path swings round the base of Sròn na Cìche before heading up the left side of lower Coire Ghrunnda. The base of the corrie is made up of huge sweeps of bare, glaciated slabs - impressive to look at but difficult to negotiate. Keep to the path which climbs high up the left side of the corrie.\n\nFurther on the path descends closer to the stream (with a cascading waterfall) and the way up to the upper corrie is barred by cliffs. The route can be continued by a moderate scramble up the rocks to the left of the waterfall. Just beyond, Coire Ghrunnda is reached. This is one of the most beautiful and impressive of all the Cuillin corries, benefiting from being much less visited than Coire Lagan.\n\nTo continue the ascent, head round to the right of the loch and then begin to climb the steep boulder field beyond aiming almost directly for Sgùrr nan Eag - there are a few small paths but you need to plan your route from the vantage point of the loch in order to avoid any crags (an easier, though longer route, would be to climb the boulders to the left of the prominent boss of rock, Caisteal a Garbh Choire and once on the ridge follow the path to the left to regain the route). The boulders in the coire give awkward going but have exceptionally good friction; they are made of peridotite, a variant of gabbro which is even rougher than normal.\n\nOnce on the ridge the views - both over to Coruisk and back down over Coire Ghrunnda to Sgùrr Alasdair- are breathtaking. Turn right along the ridge. The ascent to Sgùrr nan Eag can either be made fairly directly up the ridge (moderate scrambling) or by using a path in the scree lower down on the right (no scrambling; careful route finding needed).\n\nThe summit cairn is in the centre of the long, narrow summit ridge. At 924m this is the southernmost of the Cuillin Munros. The easiest way back is to return the same way. It is possible to continue all the way along the ridge to Gars-bheinn, where the Cuillin end above the sea - this is a delightful excursion but the return should still be made over Sgùrr nan Eag. Keen scramblers and Munro-baggers may want to include Sgùrr Dubh Mòr in the day's itinerary.\n\nTo take in Sgùrr Dubh Mòr , return along the ridge to Caisteal a Garbh Coire, and avoid this obstacle by passing round its base to the right. Beyond the bealach, the ascent of Sgùrr Dubh na Da Bheinn is a rocky scramble (keep slightly to the left of the ridge). From the summit, bear east down to the bealach, and then you must find a route up Sgùrr Dubh Mòr beyond.\n\nThe normal route is to head round to the right a little before finding a way up from ledge to ledge until the summit is reached. Either way, the ascent is a hard scramble and involves very tricky route finding; if at all unsure, why not hire a guide. With luck, the summit ridge of Sgùrr Dubh Mòr will be reached - there is a first cairn and then a second summit which may be marginally the higher of the two.\n\nReturn to Sgùrr Dubh na Da Bheinn. The return to Coire Ghrunnda can be made either by heading back down to Caisteal a Garbh Coire and descending from there, or by heading along the ridge towards the Thearlaich-Dubh gap before descending the boulders. Once back at the lochan, the return is by the route of ascent.",

The footpath begins on the opposite side of the road at the far end of the lay-by It soon leads to a footbridge high over the river; cross this and continue on the now excellent footpath uphill.\n\nAfter a couple of kilometres, just past a fine waterfall, cross the wooden plank bridge over the burn and follow the path beyond as it continues uphill. After about a kilometre the path levels off. A cairn indicates where another path heads off to the right; this leads to the start of the Pinnacle Ridge (rock climb). Instead follow the main path which slopes slightly downhill into Coire Riabhach.\n\nThe path crosses the head of the corrie keeping well above Loch a Choire Riabhaich. There are great views of Marsco and Bla Bheinn across Glen Sligachan. At the far side the path zig zags up a slightly loose slope before flattening at a shoulder. The path contours round into a second, hanging corrie. This corrie is ringed by crags; the route out heads up the obvious wide scree gully across the far side. After some distance up this gully the main scree slope heads up to the right. Instead of following this head up the boulders on the left hand slope towards a small cairn on the horizon.\n\nOn reaching the cairn there is an indistinct route across the boulders heading uphill to the right. You should soon reach the bottom of a large rock slab with cairns marking a route along the bottom to the right. Don't follow these but keep left of the crag and follow a faint path with small cairns. This path becomes clearer as it zig zags up the scree slope before eventually bearing left onto the ridge. There is a sudden stunning view out to sea and to the amazing spire of Sgùrr na h-Uamha - the final summit on the Cuillin ridge.\n\nThe summit of Sgùrr nan Gillean is now clearly visible up the ridge - appearing somewhat intimidating. Some walkers may need the reassurance of a rope on the upper sections; if you decide not to tackle it, all is not lost, as you can follow the ridge down to the left and up to the neighbouring, easier summit of Sgùrr Beag (though Sgùrr na H-Uamba is best left to rock-climbers). If you do decide to tackle Sgùrr nan Gillean, follow the ridge towards it, easily at first, keeping slightly to the left side to avoid any difficulties. Soon the route heads up a basalt dyke.\n\nFurther on is a very steep section which can either be climbed fairly directly up the ridge with the last section heading slightly to the right of the ridge, or on less steep but more exposed and less reliable sloping rocks out to the left. Above this, the ridge levels off, and narrows to a single slab shortly before the summit - this slab is well polished by shuffling bottoms!\n\nJust beyond the narrow section, a step across leads to the airy summit of Sgùrr nan Gillean. The view in all directions is fabulous; the drops around the summit are such that none of the supporting ridges can be seen, which gives the impression of floating in the air. The West Ridge, which leads towards Am Basteir, is extremely exposed and has a technical chimney lower down that requires an abseil - it should not be attempted except by experienced rock-climbers.\n\nThe excitement of being at the summit is therefore tempered by the knowledge that the only way back down is by the route of ascent - which requires even more care in this direction.",

Continue on the track up the west bank of the River Finnan for another couple of kilometres, passing the signed path for Sgùrr nan Coireachan (marked with a cairn this is the return route), keep straight ahead when a track heads down to the right and pass a waterfall on stepping stones.\n\nNear a hydro power intake bear left on the track to cross a bridge. Cross this and continue uphill on the track until you have passed a small area of trees over to your left. A short distance after this, turn left off the track (there are traces of a path and a small sign for Sgurr Thuilm) and head up towards the Druim Coire a'Bheithe ridge. The going is boggy at first; later the path becomes clearer and climbs the steepest section just to the right of a burn. The slope eases above the 600 metre contour; continue uphill on the now grassy ridge, with great views back down the glen.\n\nSgùrr Thuilm is now in view ahead. The ridge curves left and crosses a minor bump, briefly joining a line of fenceposts. The fenceposts are left behind for the final ascent to the summit. The ridge is fairly wide but there are very steep drops off either side. The cairn at 963m is the highest of the day's two Munros, with great views towards Knoydart and down to Loch Arkaig.\n\nRetrace your steps back down the last part of the ascent, returning as far as the fenceposts and then bearing right to follow these onto the knobbly ridge which leads to Sgùrr nan Coireachan. There are several rocky bumps along the ridge, but there's now a fairly worn path that can soon be picked up and is a great help with traversing them all. After crossing the first bump, there's a longer descent to the lowest point on the ridge.\n\nThe second bump is fairly minor, with only a slight descent before the climb to the third bump - Beinn Gharbh. The going is now becoming much rockier, and there's a small lochan and a great view back along the ridge to Sgùrr Thuilm. Continue towards the fourth bump - Meall an Tarmachan. This has a steep nose which can be passed on either side.\n\nAfter a very brief descent the final ascent towards Sgùrr nan Coireachan begins; there's a great view towards the wild head of Loch Morar to the right of the summit. Continue up to reach the cylindrical trig point at 956m marking the second Munro of the day. Although lower than Sgùrr Thuilm it is a better summit and a finer viewpoint.\n\nFrom here descend the broad southeast ridge. There are several bumps before a slight rise to the minor peak of Sgùrr a Choire Riabhaich. Just beyond this the ridge drops very steeply in slopes of grass and broken rock; follow the path which swings to the right when this drop is reached, making an eroded descent before it cuts back across the slope to rejoin the ridge below the steep section.\n\nContinue down a more sedate section of ridge before the ground steepens once more. This time the slope is less forbidding and the path continues down the ridge without difficulty. Further down the ridge starts to become very rocky. Eventually you'll reach the start of a well-graded stalkers path that descends to the left in a series of zig-zags before heading diagonally down the east flank of the ridge. This path leads back to the track used earlier; turn right to return to Corryhully and then continue all the way back to Glenfinnan.",

    "summary": "The view of the craggy fortress of Slioch across the waters of Loch Maree is one of the classics of Scotland featured in countless calendars. At close quarters Slioch offers a reasonably straightforward ascent given that formidable appearance, and the summit views over Loch Maree and into the Fisherfield wilderness are sensational.",
    "description": "There is a car park at the end of the minor road in Incheril (by Kinlochewe). Start the walk by taking the path at the top of the car park through the trees soon going through a gate to emerge on a wider path - turn left along this. The path continues alongside a fence, soon passing a cemetery. Eventually the path descends slightly and crosses a wooden bridge. Keep on the path, which eventually comes alongside the broad Kinlochewe river which flows in a wide, gravelly bed, passing through some native woodland.\n\nAfter about a kilometre the path cuts away from the river and then soon reaches the edge of Loch Maree, regarded by many hikers as the most beautiful loch in Scotland. Shortly afterwards the path crosses a bridge over the attractive Abhainn an Fhasaigh. Go through the gap in the gateposts ahead, and continue along the path to a fork; the path ahead here is the old Loch Maree drove route; our route turns right, gradually climbing towards Gleann Biannasdail.\n\nAt another fork ignore the path that keeps right above the gorge and instead follow the slight left fork. The next objective is the col to the west of Meall Each; the path for this forks off left but there are several alternative start points - the one shown on our map is the second, which forks left around 400m after crossing the rocky bed and a small burn. The path climbs gradually at first by two small burns, and then more steeply towards the col. The ground can be wet at times, but the view back over the foot of Loch Maree to the Beinn Eighe range is superb.\n\nOnce you reach the col the ascent becomes much more gradual, rounding the base of Sgùrr Dubh to enter the grass bowl of Coire na Sleaghaich. Paths fork off right at several points - ignore these to continue up towards the upper corrie. Eventually the path cuts sharply left to climb diagonally up to gain the ridge that forms the west wall of the corrie, reaching the ridge near some attractive lochans.\n\nBeyond the lochans the climb becomes steep and eroded, initially over rocky ground which later becomes grassy once more. There are sensational views looking back over the lochans. The path is braided on the eroded section, but soon becomes clearer, keeping just to the left of the sandstone outcrops around point 933m.\n\nContinue across a slight dip to climb up to the trig point. This is still not quite the highest point of the mountain however; for that, continue for a short distance to reach the cairn on the northern peak, the true summit of Slioch (meaning the Spear). The view from here is surely amongst the finest from the Munros, and an ample reward for all your exertions. Loch Maree takes centre centre, with the Hebrides seen beyond on a fine day.\n\nThe Torridon peaks in the west look fantastic, but it is the view northwards over the Fisherfield and Letterewe Forests takes the breath away. To vary the return, start along the east ridge - An t-Aon Cheum. Look out for the wild goats that frequent the mountain - they are descended from domestic goats that were kept hundreds of years ago - you might also see similar goats on Seana Bhràigh, Ardnmeanach on Mull and several other locations.\n\nThis soon narrows, and retains those superb views. It leads eventually to the fine peak of Sgùrr an Tuill Bhain. From here the natural line descends southeast for half a kilometre or so down the ridge until a convenient point to strike off southwards and then southwest into the corrie over pathless ground. Cross the burn and then aim to pick up the outward path at the bealach between Sgùrr Dubh and Meall Each.\n\nNow retrace your steps for the rest of the long walk back to Kinlochewe. If you are feeling footsore, remember that in the future, whenever you see that classic view of Slioch from across Loch Maree, you'll know you made it to the top.",

    "summary": "Liathach is rated by many mountaineers and hillwalkers as Scotland's finest mountain, challenged only by An Teallach and the Cuillin of Skye. Its traverse is an expedition that will be remembered forever.",
    "description": "There is space for several cars to park at the start of the path a couple of hundred metres east of Glen Cottage; there are more spaces slightly nearer the cottage. Liathach looms high overhead from here, looking impossible to climb, but there is actually a well-made path to begin with. This starts from the layby just west of the Allt an Doire Ghairbh stream, soon crossing it and then climbing steeply up the far bank.\n\nThere is a minor bit of scrambling and the path is consistently steep until it begins to ease into the coire of Toll a' Meitheach. The respite from the steepness is short, however, as soon the path begins climbing relentlessly once more; when the route ahead appears blocked the path swings to the right. There are a couple of short simple rocky scrambles where the path climbs up through weaknesses in the sandstone terraces.\n\nThe path reaches the ridge a little southwest of Stùc a' Choire Dhubh Bhig at a point marked by a cairn. The sudden view down the other side of the mountain into the wild country on the north side of Torridon takes the breath away. Before heading for the summit, it is worth detouring out to the top of Stùc a' Choire Dhubh Bhig - the easternmost summit on the ridge - for a great view of Beinn Eighe across the deep trench of Coire Dubh, as well as a better perspective on the grand ridge ahead to Spidean a' Choire Lèith. Return to the cairn at the top of the both and continue along the ridge towards the summit.\n\nContinue along the main ridge on the well-worn path, crossing the two tops of Stob a'Choire Liath Mhor, the first of which has a wind-shelter cairn. The summits are littered with quartzite boulders which make for slow going, but the situation is spectacular. After the second summit there is a short descent before the longer climb up the impressive summit cone of Spidean a'Choire Lèith, which is covered with more angular boulders.\n\nThe summit - the highest point on the whole Liathach ridge - is a sensational viewpoint, with the full ridge of the mountain now being revealed. On the descent from Spidean a' Choire Lèith great care in poor visibility to both avoid following the ridge which heads SSE to end in a precipitous prow which projects out from the mountain or to end up descending towards crags above Coire na Caime. Instead the true route heads briefly south then southwest down a steep slope of massive boulders to reach a narrow bealach.\n\nThe sight ahead should set the pulses racing, as the next section of the ridge is riven into the famous Am Fasarinen pinnacles. If all these are traversed along the crest there is a conseridable amount of exposed scrambling to negotiate. Alternatively there is a path which traverses along natural shelves below the pinnacles on the south side to avoid the scrambling, but it is sensationally exposed, particularly at a couple of spots where it also tends to be wet. You might be able to see your parked car when looking down between your feet! Great care is needed as any slip would be fatal. This section continues for several hundred metres.\n\nThe path rejoins the ridge just beyond the last pinnacle. The ridge now changes character completely and leads without further obstacle (albeit with huge cliffs plunging on the right) uphill to the second Munro of Mullach an Rathain. The summit gives a wonderful view back of the entire ridge, as well as into the wild country on the north side of the mountain.\n\nThe view west is a complete contrast, dominated by Beinn Alligin and the glittering waters of Loch Torridon, with Skye and the other islands beyond if the day is clear. To begin the descent follow the line of a stony path southwest diagonally downhill from Mullach an Rathain towards a shoulder, before heading left to descend the very steep earthy/scree slope; there is a zig-zag path which helps a little but this part of the descent is trying.\n\nFurther down the path begins to improve, and has even been pitched with stone steps in places. It continues down to the grassy floor of Toll Ban for a brief respite in the very steep descent - but you are still less than half way down at this point! Soon the path steepens once more, keeping close by the burn at first before bearing right away from it. There are a few slight scrambly sections in places as the path winds around to find a route through the terraces of sandstone cliffs to return to the Torridon road, two kilometres west of where you started.",

    "summary": "Beinn Eighe is the bulkiest of the trinity of great Torridon peaks. The western half of its ridge contains both of its two Munros. This section of the ridge makes a fine traverse with magnificent views; it may involve less scrambling than Beinn Alligin or Liathach, but compensation comes when Coire Mhic Fhearchair is reached during the descent; this is the most spectacular of all Torridon's corries.",
    "description": "This classic circuit is described clockwise in most guides but the steep screes above Coire Mhic Fhearchair are marginally more tolerable if taken in descent, so an anti-clockwise circuit may be preferred. Park in the Coire Mhic Nobuil car park (where the path returns from the hill) and begin by walking 2km east along the road. Turn left on the track to the parking area at Coire an Laoigh, which is an alternative start / parking point (leaving the short road walk until the end). A cairn marks the start of the footpath up towards Coire na Laoigh.\n\nThe path climbs gently at first up the grassy slopes before steepening as it climbs up towards the corrie between the main ridge and the projecting spur of Stùc Coire an Laoigh. Great views open up looking back across Loch Bharranch to Sgùrr Dubh and the mountains of the Coulin Forest.\n\nMuch higher up the path reaches the grassy floor of Coire an Laoigh for a brief respite before beginning a very steep climb up the headwall to reach the ridge between Stùc Coire an Laoigh and Beinn Eighe itself. At this point there is a large cairn and a stunning sudden view ahead of Liathach - looking like an unassailable battleship. Turn right to continue the ascent, with the path winding its way up a mass of quartzite scree.\n\nThe main ridge is gained at an Ordnance Survey trig point at 972 metres. In misty conditions with careless navigation this could be mistaken for the first Munro of the day, Spidean Coire nan Clach, but in fact the summit involves a detour along the ridge to the right. The crest is narrow and composed of quartzite, but a path leads along to the true summit, bypassing a rocky outcrop along the way. Shortly before the top there is a mild scramble up a quartzite staircase which could be slippery if the rocks are wet. Once at the tiny cairn, there is a fine view over the eastern summits of Beinn Eighe. These are not classed as separate Munros but are fine summits linked by airy ridges including the notorious Black Carls pinnacles, and are well worth a days outing in their own right.\n\nReturn to the trig pillar and this time continue along the ridge to the west. The quartzite stones soon give way to a slabby sandstone crest that gives firmer going to a minor top before the stones return on the descent to a bealach at 820 metres.\n\nThe bealach and the climb beyond is uncharacteristically grassy and gentle, with great views back on the way up to the flat summit of Coinneach Mhor; in fact the top of the Triple Buttress, one of Scotland's finest cliffs, is only a short distance away to the west. From the cairn descend the steep and stony ridge to the narrow bealach which separates Ruadh-stac Mhòr from the main ridge of Beinn Eighe.\n\nThe first part of the climb up to Ruadh-stac Mhòr is very rocky and rough but soon becomes easier on a plateau before the final short pull up the summit scree-cone. Although not on the main ridge, this is the highest of Beinn Eighe's summits, and its detached position makes it a fabulous viewpoint for most of the range. Return to the bealach between the top and Coinneach Mhor. There is only one way down to the floor of Coire Mhic Fhearchair for non-climbers, and that is down the very steep and narrow scree gully heading northwest from here. Take great care on the descent, keeping to the right edge of the scree as the bedrock is exposed in places making a rocky staircase - though keep an eye out for loose rocks. The gully narrows at one point where it is almost blocked by a chockstone which is passed on the right.\n\nContinue down the right edge of the scree until below the broken cliffs, where a path continues the descent northwest between the scree and the bottom of the cliffs. Descend on this path until it too heads left down the lower section of scree; finally pick your way down the steep boulders to reach the flatter ground below. You are now below the screes but there is still some way to go before the easier terrain at the bottom of the corrie is reached. Head over to the left to pick up a path that continues the descent, staying fairly close to the bottom of the cliffs on the south side of the corrie. The path picks its way down several sandstone terraces and descends past some beautiful little pools and waterfalls to reach Lochan Coire Mhic Fhearchair.\n\nContinue on the path round the eastern shores of this beautiful lochan. Behind you is the magnificent Triple Buttress, seen to best effect when the far end of the lochan is reached. The exit stream from the lochan is a very popular spot for walkers coming up the path from Glen Torridon, with its classic view across the water to the masterpiece of rock architecture beyond. Cross the outflow from the loch to pick up an excellent stalkers path. This descends round the lower slopes of Sàil Mhòr - with views back of some attractive waterfalls below the loch outflow - contouring right round the base of the peak and offering fine views into the wild country behind Torridon. The path is rocky but very well constructed, and eventually leads to a large cairn at a junction with a path from Coire Mhic Nobuil. Keep left, on the main path, to descend Coire Dubh Mòr , and eventually return to the A896.",

Begin by heading back east along the road for 400m until a small cairn marks the start of another stalkers' path, this time for Spidean Mialach. The boggy path looks unpromising at first as it climbs through a tunnel of rhododendron but it soon reaches open countryside and climbs gently up the hillside to the right and passing beneath electricity pylons.\n\nThe route continues to gain height into the somewhat soggy Coire Mheil; keep to the path and cross the Allt Coire Mheil. The path now slopes uphill to reach the Allt Coire Dubh and heads up alongside this stream until it forks. Cross here and follow the now very faint path aiming for the slopes of Spidean Mialach, just north of the bealach above Loch Fearna which comes into view. Aim directly for the ridge aiming to reach it just before Spidean Mialach, the climb is steep but most of the stony areas higher up can be avoided. Once on the ridge bear right to reach the summit.\n\nThe large summit cairn is perched right on the edge of the dramatic northern cliffs. At 996 metres it is the smaller of the day's two Munros. Leave the summit by heading southwest at first along the ridge, there is a small path.\n\nThe route now becomes much more dramatic, as the ridge has a series of steep rocky corries on its northern side, looking across to the South Glen Shiel ridge. Keep close to this cliff edge as the ridge heads gently northwest at first bending left and then right on a steeper descent down to the Fiar Bhealaich at 735m.\n\nFrom the bealach, a stalkers path winds its way up the steep slopes opposite; the climb eases twice before reaching the Top of Creag Coire na Fiar Bhealaich. From here the ridge descents gently before a final rocky climb to the large cairn on Gleouraich, at 1035m the second Munro of the day.\n\nAfter enjoying the extensive views of Kintail and into Knoydart, continue along the ridge, which soon turns sharply to the left (southwest) and descends onto a fine stalkers path once more.\n\nThe path descends to a flattish shoulder with a great view across Loch Quoich to Sgùrr na Cìche, before descending just below the top of the Druim Seilleach ridge on the west side.\n\nThis section of stalkers path is absolutely fantastic, with a tremendous feeling of space given by the very steep drop to the northern arm of Loch Quoich far below. Further down the path runs back onto the ridge and descends the Sròn a Chuillin in a series of zigzags. It then heads downhill southeast towards the Allt Coire Peitireach and returns to the road after a short, boggy section through dense rhododendrons, to emerge opposite the parking area.",

Soon the track enters the forest and passes the entrances to a couple of groups of chalets.\n\nWhen the track forks, take the right fork (also the Great Glen Way) and continuing on the track which rises gently through the trees. Eventually the track descends very slightly, and after about two and a half kilometres beyond the fork there is a boulder and a footpath sign on the right of the track; this is the place to turn off right onto the footpath.\n\nThe well constructed path climbs steeply through the dense forest. Eventually it passes through a gate, and beyond this it becomes stony as it climbs through an area of natural birchwoods. There is a fine waterfall almost hidden by the trees down to the left. All trees are soon left behind and the 'Cam Bhealach' path continues clearly along the north side of the valley of the Allt Glas Doire, aiming for the narrow pass between the two hills. This route follows the line of an old 'Coffin Road' and was used by crofters from the remote region to the north to carry their dead to the graveyard at Kilfinnan. Continue right up to the bealach itself.\n\nBoth Munros are readily climbed from here. Sròn a' Choire Garbh rises steeply on the north side of the bealach, but there is an excellent stalkers path which zig-zags to and fro up the slope, making the ascent much easier.\n\nEventually the stalkers path ends; continue up across grassy open slopes to reach the edge of the broken cliffs above Coire Garbh. Bear left to make the final short walk northwest along the edge to reach the summit cairn. Sròn a' Choire Ghairbh is 937m, and gives impressive views looking northeast along the Great Glen, as well as over towards the Knoydart mountains.\n\nMost eyes, however, will be drawn to the next Munro, Meall na Teanga, backed by Ben Nevis. Retrace your steps all the way back down the stalkers' path to return to the bealach.\n\nThis time head south from the bealach, initially up a steep and worn path. This climbs above a gully before cutting across the slopes to reach a broad grassy bealach between Meall Dubh and Meall na Teanga. From here the path climbs steeply once more before cutting across the slope to gain the broad north ridge of Meall na Teanga. Turn south along this to reach the summit. There are excellent views down to Loch Lochy far below. A\n\nAt 918m Meall na Teanga is one of the smaller Munros, but it has a better view than its higher neighbour - with Ben Nevis and Loch Linnhe being very well seen in good conditions, whilst a narrow ridge leads on towards its southwestern summit - Meall Coire Lochain.\n\nRetrace your steps once more back down to the bealach, and then follow the coffin path back into the forest and return to Kilfinnan.",

Begin the walk by heading along the track from the far end of the turning area, signed as a private road - works vehicles only. The track soon leads through a gate and continues through attractive birch woodland towards the Loch Treig dam. When it forks - with the dam visible in the distance - stay on the main right hand branch. Soon the track forks again - stay on the main left hand branch keeping close to the dam and loch.\n\nAlmost a kilometre beyond the dam two tracks branch off to the right in quick succession. The first is the track which climbed off earlier coming back down to the track; ignore this and take the second track, which climbs uphill and soon becomes grassy as it leads up to a sheepfold. Beyond the sheepfold very muddy ATV tracks lead on up the moorland, keeping to the right of a burn before crossing it and swinging left below where a small waterfall is shaded by birch trees. The very muddy and rough tyre tracks emerge up on the moor just to the left of a concrete hydro pillar. From here Meall Cian Dearg rises as an impressively steep cone guarding the ridge ahead.\n\nA very muddy path - briefly indistinct - leads directly towards Meall Cian Dearg, soon steepening to begin the ascent. Higher up the path zig-zags to and fro to pass steeply up through the crags near the top; this section is very eroded and requires great care. Above Meall Cian Dearg the character of the ridge changes, becoming broad and somewhat featureless if visibility is poor. Continue across fairly level ground at first until the ridge begins to climb once more towards point 978m.\n\nThe tiny cairn heralds the start of another more level section of ridge, curving gently above the steep slopes of Coire Aluinn which sweep down to Loch Treig. Eventually the ground steepens once more for the final climb up to the first Munro summit, Stob a' Choire Mheadhoin.\n\nThe top takes the form of a small plateau, with the summit windshelter cairn at 1105m enjoying a spectacular view of the Grey Corries. Continue across the pathless summit area to reach the start of the descent down to the bealach to the southwest.\n\nThe slopes soon become stony but a path helps progress. Stob Coire Easain looks very impressive ahead, its fine peaked form towering over Coire Easain Beag. From the bealach the ascent begins gradually but steepens and becomes rocky towards the summit, which is spectacularly located on the rim of the northern crags. The views are very fine, extending across Rannoch Moor as well as the Nevis ranges.\n\nThe best descent is to retrace your steps back to the bealach and up over Stob a' Choire Mheadhoin (the alternative descent northwards from the bealach is steep initially and leads to a very long and boggy walk out - not recommended).\n\nAfter Stob a' Choire Mheadhoin, continue reversing the outward route all the way back along the ridge. There are very extensive views across the glen towards the Creag Meagaidh ranges. Take care on the steep descent from Meall Cian Dearg, and bear just right of the hydro pillar to continue back to the start.",

The views from here are superb in all directions, but particularly stunning is the vast expanse of Rannoch Moor to the north, seemingly as much water as land; this summit is well worthwhile as an easier hillwalk in its own right and less experienced hillwalkers should return the same way from here.\n\nTo continue to Stob Ghabhar, leave the summit by following the broad west ridge down to the bealach at 668 metres. From here follow the path that climbs to the west, keeping left at an indistinct fork. The path now ascends WSW for about three hundred metres.\n\nThe route from here however climbs more directly up the very steep slopes to the south, roughly following the boundary marked on OS maps; there is a path in places but care is needed as the slope is unpleasantly loose with scree and rocks and the view back down towards Coirein Lochain could be intimidating to some; careful navigation is needed. The ridge of Aonach Eagach above is likely to be reached with some relief.\n\nTurn right along the path on the crest of the ridge; there is one very narrow section but no real difficulties - it is a very fine ridge but no rival to its more famous namesake the Aonach Eagach in nearby Glencoe.\n\nAfter crossing a notch a short rocky ascent follows before a cairn is reached (marking the descent route for later). Continue along the ridge as it curves round to reach the final climb up beside a line of fenceposts to the fine summit of Stob Ghabhar at 1087m, close to the very edge of the crags plunging down into the corrie.\n\nReturn the same way for about 500m to a cairn, and from here follow a faint path that decends southwards to reach an old fenceline. The path then follows the fence to join the Stob Maol ridge. This is much broader and gives easier going; lower down curve round to the left towards the stream flowing out of Coire na Muic. The old fenceposts are a guide for much of the way, but make sure you cross the Allt Coire na Muic before reaching the falls at the bottom of the corrie.\n\nOnce on the far side of the burn the ground falls away very steeply in the slabby crags of Creag an Steallaire (the crags of the Falls). A very steep and eroded path - scrambly and requiring great care - descends the north side of the falls, giving fine views of the several cascades. Below this steep section continue down the easier slopes by the stream to reach the Allt Toaig. This needs to be crossed (note this could be difficult in spate) to regain the path used on the outward route. Turn right down this path to retrace your earlier steps back to Victoria Bridge.",

    "description": "The start of this walk is several kilometres up a very rough track from Corriechoille, itself just beyond the end of a minor road from Spean Bridge. Driving the track requires great care to avoid damage on the many potholes; there is parking on the left just before the track reaches a locked gate at NN255788. Continue up the track on foot; this is the historic right of way over the Lairig Leacach, on foot. After passing through a gate the track reaches the Wee Minister - a wooden sculpture who looks out across the glen. Continue on the track through areas of mature and recently felled forestry.\n\nThe track eventually crosses the Allt Leachdach and continues uphill into a pass between the Grey Corries on the right and the Corbetts of Cruach Innse and Sgùrr Innse on the left. After reaching the summit of the Lairig Leacach at 515 metres it then runs gently downhill.\n\nEventually the track leads to the tiny Lairig Leacach bothy; Stob Ban is now well seen rising as a sharp conical peak beyond. The bothy is maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting.\n\nThe track fords Allt a'Chùil Choirean, or there is a footbridge just upstream. Continue briefly along the track until a small cairn which indicates the start of a path to the right, aiming for the foot of the ridge. The going is wet and boggy at first as the path makes its way up towards point 769m, a rounded knoll to the east of Stob Ban. There are great views back down to the bothy and the dramatic, impregnable looking Corbett of Sgùrr Innse across the other side of the glen.\n\nEventually the ascent becomes drier underfoot, and a path leads across the north side of point 769m to reach the bealach beyond. Stob Ban rises impressively from here, with a steady ascent to the first shoulder, and then a very steep final ascent on a zig-zagging path close to the edge of the northern cliffs.\n\nDespite the close proximity of the much higher main ridge of the Grey Corries, the view from the quartzite cairn is wild and impressive in all directions. Ben Nevis looms large to the west, whilst the Mamores and the peaks of Glencoe are well seen.\n\nFrom here it is possible to descend a steep and loose scree slope WNW before turning north to a bealach with a lochan. This enables a link with the main Grey Corries ridge, a descent into Coire Claurigh, eventually picking up a zig-zag path to the south of quartzite slabs. The quickest and easiest return, however, is to retrace your steps by the route of ascent back to the bothy.\n\nFrom here continue along the track by the outward route to return to the start.",

    "description": "Park in the car park (charge) situated above the Glen Nevis road just before reaching the bridge at Polldubh. It is worth walking over to this bridge before starting the walk to have a good look at the Polldubh Falls (also known as the 'Lower Falls'), usually busy with coach parties - but the walk starts from the nearside of the bridge. Don't take the left hand path leading up beside the River Nevis itself, but instead take the right hand track through a gate. This becomes a path and keeps to the east side of the Allt Coire a'Mhusgain.\n\nThe path is muddy in places at first but follows the line of an old stalkers path and improves higher up. It climbs at a steady angle but fairly relentlessly, soon passing through another gate and then beneath the southwest ridge of Sgùrr a Mhaim, and keeping a fair distance above the stream in its deep ravine. The path climbs through some attractively scattered deciduous woodland before passing below a crag and then gaining a good deal of height in a series of zig-zags. It then traverses the east flank of the glen before climbing again in more zig-zags by a fine waterfall.\n\nThe path crosses a shallow upper corrie and climbs again to reach a broad bealach. Looking back, there are superb views back down the coire to Glen Nevis. To the east of the bealach is Sgòr an Iubhair (part of the Ring of Steall walk); but our route heads west up the ridge towards the impressive peak of Stob Ban.\n\nThe ridge is grassy at first narrowing, with the upper slopes of Stob Ban towering very impressively above. A path helps the ascent of the steep and shattered quartzite slopes above, keeping a little to the left initially on the climb up the final ridge which curves round above the dramatic northeast face of the mountain.\n\nThe gradient eases onto the summit of Stob Ban, which is a spectacular viewpoint; Ben Nevis looks its full height above the glen, whilst looking east the other Mamores peaks in view look magnificent. To continue the walk, follow the ridge northwards from the summit - the descent is initially over shattered quartzite rocks. You can either pass over or across the western flank of a rounded rocky knoll - both ways are equally rough underfoot.\n\nBelow this the quartzite thankfully relents and a grassier path is reached. It is possible to bypass the next knoll on the ridge - this is the culminating point of the north ridge of Stob Ban that continues for some distance before a precipitous plunge to the glen; rather than following this, our route heads for the 846m bealach to the west. Beyond this the straightforward ridge climbs up to a minor summit with a tiny area of quartzite rocks, and then continues along the ridge.\n\nFurther on the ridge narrows dramatically to a rocky crest - this can be traversed or bypassed on the left to reach another bealach. Beyond this the ridge broadens and climbs once more to a wide plateau at point 917m. There is then another short descent before the final rise to the massive cairn that marks the true summit of Mullach nan Coirean at 939m.\n\nThis flat-topped peak offers sensational views towards Loch Linnhe. Follow the ridge northwards from the summit before curving right onto the northeast ridge. The crest of the ridge leads down to eventually reach a fence and stile at 642m. Ignore the stile and continue down to the left of the fence. Further down is a second stile - again ignore this and keep left of the fence. The path now becomes very boggy and descends steeply by the fence towards the Allt a' Choire Riabhaich.\n\nNear the bottom cross a stile and follow a thankfully much drier path through some attractive native birchwoods and then through a felled area to gain a forest track. Head right along this, forking left downhill when a junction is reached. At the sharp bend ahead, take the good path which descends more directly through the trees to return to Achriabhach. Turn right along the road to return to the car park at the start.",

    "description": "The walk begins from the A85 just east of Ben More farm. It is just possible to park carefully just off the road along here; alternatively there is a large layby half a mile further east at the west end of Loch Iubhair. Look out for a low wooden sign beside the A85 marked 'Ben More'; this indicates a small path which inelegantly crosses the ditch to join a track just above the farm; turn left up this. The track winds to and fro uphill, passing under the pylons, to reach a gate at 300m.\n\nGo through the gate and take the stepped path to begin the ascent of the steep slope ahead. The ascent is unrelenting and the height of the slope was much foreshortened when seen from below, but the climb isn't quite as steep as its formidable reputation amongst walkers, and the views back are superb. The path keeps left of the ill-defined lower section of the Sloc Curraidh, a corrie high on Ben More.\n\nThe high corrie of the Sloc Curraidh has a very steep headwall and can be a dangerous trap in bad weather, or more especially in winter or spring when it is prone to avalanche - there have been fatalities. From about 800 metres there is a drystone dyke along the ridge round the north side of the corrie, and the path keeps just to the left of this (note that on the OS 1:25 000 maps the dyke is erroneously marked as a stream). Continue the ascentto reach the steepest section of the climb, gaining the rocky shoulder of Cuidhe Chrom. Once atop this the going becomes a little easier and the corrie is now below; the path swings left a little to permit views of Loch Tay before climbing the final slopes.\n\nThe summit of Ben More is marked by a large cairn and at 1174 metres there are no higher mountains in Britain anywhere further south. It is a wonderful viewpoint, from the fine form of Ben Lui in the west, round a great ark of the mountains of the southern Highlands to Ben Lawers above Loch Tay. There is a trig point a short distance beyond the cairn atop a rocky outcrop and this looks south to the elegant peak of Stob Binnein - the next destination for the walk. The descent between the two peaks is considerable, but there is a clear path. The route down from Ben More is rocky at first, with one short wall requiring a move of scrambling - though this can be avoided by diverting a little to the left. Further down the slopes are grassier though the path is a little eroded, and the Bealach Eadar da-Bheinn (the pass between the two hills) is reached at 862 metres, marked by an enormous boulder.\n\nBeyond the bealach the ascent up to Stob Binnein begins. Again the path is clear and it zig-zags slightly to ease the long climb. There are no special difficulties and the small, flat summit of Stob Binnein should be reached without incident. At 1165 metres it may be slightly lower than Ben More, but Stob Binnein is the finer and more elegant peak. The view south takes in much of the Trossachs seen over a foreground of Stob Binnein's south ridge. This ridge too carries a path, this one leading to Inverlochlarig in the glen above Balquhidder - a long distance from the start by road.\n\nUnless you are undertaking a traverse, you should descend back down the north ridge to the bealach once more. From the bealach the descent path begins gently at first by desceding across the slopes below Ben More. Further down the descent becomes steeper and more direct by a burn. This leads all the way down to the glen and is boggy and slightly eroded in places. Once in the glen pick up the track and follow this down the glen; it eventually reaches the gate where the track was left earlier; pass through to return down the zigzags and eventually the A85 and the start of the walk.",

    "description": "The start of this walk is several kilometres up a very rough track from Corriechoille, itself just beyond the end of a minor road from Spean Bridge. Driving the track requires great care. The best place to park is where another track branches right at NN252793. Begin the walk by continuing on the track southeast. It soon passes further parking space where it crosses the line of a now-vanished tramway connected with the Fort William aluminium works. Pass through a gate, soon passing the Wee Minister - a wooden replacement for an old stone statue who looks out back across the glen. Continue ahead past areas of forestry with great views back.\n\nOnce the plantation on the right ends, go through the gate, but continue on the track to a second gate to avoid entering the enclosed square of ground on the right. After the second gate turn right across very boggy, pathless terrain, passing around the enclosed area and then steeply uphill with the fence and forest to your right. After passing the steepest lower slopes curve south up the open and grassy but wet slopes leading up to Stob Coire Gaibhre, a long and unremitting ascent. From here, the walk improves dramatically, with views across the corrie on the left with its tiny lochan to the outlying top of Stob Coire na Ceannain. There is a very brief descent before a gradual and then steeper and stonier climb up to point 1121m.\n\nUnless you wish to make a detour out to Stob Coire na Ceannain, ignore the ridge leading off east, instead making a brief steep climb to gain the sharp slabby arête ahead. The crest here is narrow but easily bypassed by paths on the right side. It leads up to a first cairned summit (the photo shows the view back from here); continue along the crest to reach Stob Choire Claurigh. This first Munro of the day is the fifteenth highest mountain in Britain and enjoys a fine panorama. The outlier of the Grey Corries, Stob Ban, is to the south, but most eyes will be on the snaking main ridge leading away to the west.\n\nThe ridge leading on is broad and stony initially but there is a worn path that eases the going. It descends at first before a slight climb up to point 1105m. The ridge now curves gracefully and narrows as it descends on grass before a stony pull onto a rocky crest bordered by steep crags on the left side, before continuing to the next minor summit, Stob Coire Cath na Sine.\n\nThe ridge now switches direction more to the west, and crosses another area of stones before the ascent up to Caisteal at 1106m. From here there is a great view of the next section of ridge leading to the second Munro, Stob Coire an Laoigh, with steep crags on the right.\n\nFrom Stob Coire an Laoigh there is a stony descent and climb to the next summit, Stob Coire Easain at 1080 metres. Now, a decision must be made. If you have enough energy, it is well worth continuing along the ridge to take in a third Munro, Sgùrr Chòinnich Mhòr - the most shapely of the Grey Corries, before returning to this point. Those who are already tired will want to omit this part of the walk and continue at paragraph 5. To include the extra peak, head down the well defined ridge to the south southwest to reach the wide Bealach Coire Easain. The next section of ascent is very steep, followed by a fine ridge leading to the summit of the pyramidal peak of Sgùrr Chòinnich Mòr . This is the third Munro of the day at 1094m. Return to the bealach and back up to Stob Coire Easain.\n\nDescend the initially steep and stony slopes to the north northeast. These soon become easier angled and grassy, becoming a better defined ridge with some minor peaks over Beinn na Socaich. There are excellent views back to the main Grey Corries ridge.\n\nContinuing the descent, the slopes become increasingly open and grassy, and finally tussocky and wet in places. Once the edge of the forestry draws close aim for a pedestrian gate in the forest fence. From here an ill-defined path leads through a gap in the young forestry plantation. Continue ahead until a minor hillock; the path improves to lead down to the left of this, emerging on a forest track. Turn right along the track.\n\nThe track soon leads over a bridge; continue slightly uphill to reach a t-junction. Most guidebooks recommend taking the line of the old tramway back to the start, but much of the route has become extremely boggy and overgrown, and the bridges are missing. Instead turn left and follow the track downhill. At a track junction (with Spean Bridge signed ahead) follow the main track which bends right. Ignore a track off to the left, and at a second junction take the left fork downhill (ignoring the track climbing slightly right). This eventually leads back to the access track from Coirecoille and the start.",

Head down this track and over the bridge over the picturesque River Etive. Beyond this a junction is reached - keep right here and follow the hydro track. At Coiletir a sign indicates a path round the cottage to the left; this route then follows a fenceline across the hillside to NN138457, but it's extremely boggy. It's better to stay on the hydro track that bypasses Coiletir to the right. Eventually the track reaches the Allt Mheuran. Don't cross the bridge but head up the left side of the burn; this section is overgrown and tussocky but for a much shorter distance than the direct route to NN138457.\n\nSoon you'll see a series of waterfalls above the confluence of the Allt Meirleach and the Allt Mheuran, and the going becomes slightly easier. The path eventually comes closer and then runs beside the Allt Mheuran above the gorges. Continue on the path up the valley; there are good views across to Ben Starav and the conical peak of Glas Bheinn Mhor, and waterslides and small falls in the stream add interest on the long ascent to the bealach between Glas Bheinn Mhòr and Stob Coir'an Albanaich.\n\nClimb the steep slope of grass and stones to the north to reach a flat shoulder. Stob Coir'an Albannaich can now be seen as a gentle dome ahead across a shallow depression; the easiest ascent is to contour round to the left to avoid the dip before ascending the slope to the ridge. At the top of this slope the landscape changes completely as the hill collapses on its northern side into deep, slabby corries. Turn right along the rim of these cliffs to reach the summit. This is the first Munro of the day, at 1044metres; there is a large, old grassy-grown cairn topped by a smaller, newer one, and a grand view of the Glencoe hills.\n\nThe traverse to the next Munro involves some convoluted route-finding which would be tricky in mist. Descend the initially steep and well-defined eastern ridge to where it begins to level off. The route down to the bealach involves turning left down a rake through the cliffs. There are two such rakes; the first is just before a rocky knobble - do not turn down this one, but continue a little further along the ridge to a second rake. This may be marked by a cairn and has a fair path starting down it; initially the path descends some slabby rocks before bearing left slightly to the descend a grassy gulley to the bealach.\n\nFrom the bealach, ascend the intervening peak of Meall Tarsuinn, which has large areas of flat rocky slabs. A path descends the far side of Beinn Tarsuinn, winding between steeper slabs, to reach a second bealach. From here, the ascent up onto the broad, grassy dome of Meall nan Eun is more straightforward in good visibility. The summit, which is over to the right, is at 928 metres making it the second Munro of the day; without this status this peak would be little visited. There is a good view towards Loch Tulla and the Bridge of Orchy mountains, though the sprawling plateau robs the view of any depth.\n\nHead northwest back across the plateau and continue down the steep slopes of the hill into Coire Riabhach. This slope has many steep crags and finding a safe route down the grass between them requires great care. Further down, continue across the less steep but very rough, tussocky terrain to reach the Allt Ceitlin. After the rough going, a hydro track is reached. Follow this down to Glen Etive, through two gates. Turn left along this track to a junction with another track; turn right here to head back across the bridge over the River Etive and return to the start.",

    "description": "Park at the car park at the very end of the road up Glen Nevis. There is a tremendous water slide descending from Ben Nevis here. Follow the main path up the glen into predominantly deciduous woodland. The path is very popular but the surface is rocky in places. After a few hundred metres the glen curves to the right and narrows, with the cliffs across the river giving some of the feel of an Alpine gorge. The path continues up the glen and soon emerges from the trees. The section of the more open glen ahead makes a tremendous view, with the green pastures of the valley floor surrounded by fine woodland backed by great mountains - with as centrepiece the great Steall Falls, a tremendous waterfall where a stream cascades four hundred feet down a broken cliff into the glen.\n\nBear right off the main path onto a smaller one heading for the steel-cable bridge. This consists of three cables - two for handrails, and one on which you can balance your boots. The brave will edge across it, high over the river, whilst the more circumspect will paddle across the shallows just upstream (impossible in spate conditions). Once across, turn left and pass the Steall Hut (private) and continue into the woods to cross the burn on the rocks at the very base of the Steall falls. If in spate, this may be easier on the flats just downstream.\n\nContinue around the base of the next buttress on extremely boggy ground. Once beyond this take the stalkers' path heading uphill. It soon reaches a section where a landslip has destroyed the old path - continue up steeply beside this. There are great views back over the Steall Meadows. Further up the path improves, eventually traversing right across the corrie, whereupon it continues uphill in a series of zigzags until heading to the right onto the shoulder of a grassy ridge.\n\nFollow the path that climbs steeply southeast up this ridge. Above the steep section the ascent finally relents a little along a straightforward grassy section before the final pull up to the summit of An Gearanach. This is the first Munro of the day, at 982 metres, and has tremendous views both back to Ben Nevis and across to Sgùrr a' Mhaim.\n\nFrom here, continue along the ridge which narrows to the dramatic, rocky arête of An Garbhanach. The traverse of this 'Top' is an airy but fairly straightforward but exposed scramble, reminiscent but a little harder than the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arete. The scrambling continues as the ridge heads down to the next bealach. Continue by climbing up to Stob Coire a' Chàirn; the scrambling is over for now but the ridge steepens with some scree towards the top. The cairn is at 981 metres and is the second Munro of the day; there are great views, particularly of the Grey Corries and eastern Mamores. Descend the much easier, grassy southwest ridge, traversing over a minor summit, before beginning the steep climb up to Am Bodach. This is rocky and a little loose, so care is needed with the mild scrambling on the ascent. Am Bodach (The Old Man) is 1032m high - the third Munro of the day.\n\nDescend the easier west ridge which drops down to another bealach before a straightforward climb up to Sgùrr an Iubhair. At 1001 metres, this was briefly a Munro between 1981 and 1997, a promotion and relegation in status that only the Scottish Mountaineering Club could explain! The route now turns north away from the main spine of the Mamores, following instead what has been named 'The Devil's Ridge'. It begins easily enough as it descends NNW to a wide bealach, before beginning the traverse of the 'Top' of Stob Coire a' Mhail. This is an excitingly exposed and narrow arete, mainly grassy with a path along the crest.\n\nOn the descent from the Top, there is one trickier section of ridge composed of shattered rocks. It can be scrambled over, but most walkers avoid it by taking a bypass path which descends a little on the left, climbing back to the ridge just beyond. A short distance further the descent of a rock step is the final minor obstacle - this is most easily climbed down by starting on the right and descending it diagonally towards the left. Beyond, the ridge continues easily to Sgùrr a' Mhaim, the latter section being on the quartzite stones that give this mountain the appearance of being snow covered. There are great views back along the Devil's Ridge.\n\nSgùrr a' Mhaim is the fourth and final Munro of the day, and its position away from the main ridge makes it a magnificent viewpoint; Stob Ban looks especially fine to the southwest. Do not be tempted to descend the northeast ridge towards Steall, as there is difficult and dangerous steep ground much lower down which has been the scene of fatal accidents. Instead, take the easier northwest ridge, down shattered quartzite at first.\n\nThe ridge becomes grassier lower down but the descent is pretty unrelentingly steep. It eventually leads to path above the Allt Coire a' Mhusgain. Follow this path down to reach the road just east of the Lower Falls car park. Turn right at the road but then immediately right again befeore the bridge to take the path on the near side of the river until Paddy's Bridge at NN158684 before using that to return to the tarmac.

Continue ahead past areas of forestry with great views back.\n\nOnce the plantation on the right ends, go through the gate, but continue on the track to a second gate to avoid entering the enclosed square of ground on the right. After the second gate turn right across very boggy, pathless terrain, passing around the enclosed area and then steeply uphill with the fence and forest to your right. After passing the steepest lower slopes curve south up the open and grassy but wet slopes leading up to Stob Coire Gaibhre, a long and unremitting ascent. From here, the walk improves dramatically, with views across the corrie on the left with its tiny lochan to the outlying top of Stob Coire na Ceannain. There is a very brief descent before a gradual and then steeper and stonier climb up to point 1121m.\n\nUnless you wish to make a detour out to Stob Coire na Ceannain, ignore the ridge leading off east, instead making a brief steep climb to gain the sharp slabby arête ahead. The crest here is narrow but easily bypassed by paths on the right side. It leads up to a first cairned summit (the photo shows the view back from here); continue along the crest to reach Stob Choire Claurigh. This first Munro of the day is the fifteenth highest mountain in Britain and enjoys a fine panorama. The outlier of the Grey Corries, Stob Ban, is to the south, but most eyes will be on the snaking main ridge leading away to the west.\n\nThe ridge leading on is broad and stony initially but there is a worn path that eases the going. It descends at first before a slight climb up to point 1105m. The ridge now curves gracefully and narrows as it descends on grass before a stony pull onto a rocky crest bordered by steep crags on the left side, before continuing to the next minor summit, Stob Coire Cath na Sine.\n\nThe ridge now switches direction more to the west, and crosses another area of stones before the ascent up to Caisteal at 1106m. From here there is a great view of the next section of ridge leading to the second Munro, Stob Coire an Laoigh, with steep crags on the right.\n\nFrom Stob Coire an Laoigh there is a stony descent and climb to the next summit, Stob Coire Easain at 1080 metres. Now, a decision must be made. If you have enough energy, it is well worth continuing along the ridge to take in a third Munro, Sgùrr Chòinnich Mhòr - the most shapely of the Grey Corries, before returning to this point. Those who are already tired will want to omit this part of the walk and continue at paragraph 5. To include the extra peak, head down the well defined ridge to the south southwest to reach the wide Bealach Coire Easain. The next section of ascent is very steep, followed by a fine ridge leading to the summit of the pyramidal peak of Sgùrr Chòinnich Mòr . This is the third Munro of the day at 1094m. Return to the bealach and back up to Stob Coire Easain.\n\nDescend the initially steep and stony slopes to the north northeast. These soon become easier angled and grassy, becoming a better defined ridge with some minor peaks over Beinn na Socaich. There are excellent views back to the main Grey Corries ridge.\n\nContinuing the descent, the slopes become increasingly open and grassy, and finally tussocky and wet in places. Once the edge of the forestry draws close aim for a pedestrian gate in the forest fence. From here an ill-defined path leads through a gap in the young forestry plantation. Continue ahead until a minor hillock; the path improves to lead down to the left of this, emerging on a forest track. Turn right along the track.\n\nThe track soon leads over a bridge; continue slightly uphill to reach a t-junction. Most guidebooks recommend taking the line of the old tramway back to the start, but much of the route has become extremely boggy and overgrown, and the bridges are missing. Instead turn left and follow the track downhill. At a track junction (with Spean Bridge signed ahead) follow the main track which bends right. Ignore a track off to the left, and at a second junction take the left fork downhill (ignoring the track climbing slightly right). This eventually leads back to the access track from Coirecoille and the start.",

    "description": "Park at the end of the public road which leads to Fersit, where there is a very large turning area; park carefully to avoid obstructing any turning vehicles. Begin the walk by heading along the track from the far end of the turning area, signed as a private road - works vehicles only. The track soon leads through a gate and continues through attractive birch woodland towards the Loch Treig dam. When it forks - with the dam visible in the distance - stay on the main right hand branch. Soon the track forks again - stay on the main left hand branch keeping close to the dam and loch.\n\nAlmost a kilometre beyond the dam two tracks branch off to the right in quick succession. The first is the track which climbed off earlier coming back down to the track; ignore this and take the second track, which climbs uphill and soon becomes grassy as it leads up to a sheepfold. Beyond the sheepfold very muddy ATV tracks lead on up the moorland, keeping to the right of a burn before crossing it and swinging left below where a small waterfall is shaded by birch trees. The very muddy and rough tyre tracks emerge up on the moor just to the left of a concrete hydro pillar. From here Meall Cian Dearg rises as an impressively steep cone guarding the ridge ahead.\n\nA very muddy path - briefly indistinct - leads directly towards Meall Cian Dearg, soon steepening to begin the ascent. Higher up the path zig-zags to and fro to pass steeply up through the crags near the top; this section is very eroded and requires great care. Above Meall Cian Dearg the character of the ridge changes, becoming broad and somewhat featureless if visibility is poor. Continue across fairly level ground at first until the ridge begins to climb once more towards point 978m.\n\nThe tiny cairn heralds the start of another more level section of ridge, curving gently above the steep slopes of Coire Aluinn which sweep down to Loch Treig. Eventually the ground steepens once more for the final climb up to the first Munro summit, Stob a' Choire Mheadhoin.\n\nThe top takes the form of a small plateau, with the summit windshelter cairn at 1105m enjoying a spectacular view of the Grey Corries. Continue across the pathless summit area to reach the start of the descent down to the bealach to the southwest.\n\nThe slopes soon become stony but a path helps progress. Stob Coire Easain looks very impressive ahead, its fine peaked form towering over Coire Easain Beag. From the bealach the ascent begins gradually but steepens and becomes rocky towards the summit, which is spectacularly located on the rim of the northern crags. The views are very fine, extending across Rannoch Moor as well as the Nevis ranges.\n\nThe best descent is to retrace your steps back to the bealach and up over Stob a' Choire Mheadhoin (the alternative descent northwards from the bealach is steep initially and leads to a very long and boggy walk out - not recommended).\n\nAfter Stob a' Choire Mheadhoin, continue reversing the outward route all the way back along the ridge. There are very extensive views across the glen towards the Creag Meagaidh ranges. Take care on the steep descent from Meall Cian Dearg, and bear just right of the hydro pillar to continue back to the start.",

From here a path soon joins the Right of Way (signposted from just down the road) through the Lairig Èilde. The path has been greatly improved by the National Trust for Scotland, and soon leads up to a fork where the Lairig Èilde route bears right; keep left here to stay on the excellent path up towards the ridge. Already there are good views of Bidean nam Bian and the Aonach Eagach ridge over to the right.\n\nThe path heads diagonally up the hillside for a time before aiming more directly uphill - with the aid of rocky steps - towards the Mam Buidhe, the lowest point on the ridge. Bidean nam Bian's subsidiary Munro - Stob Coire Sgreamhach - looks impressive from here.\n\nEventually the gradient begins to ease and the path forks on the final approach to the bealach. To climb the highest peak - Stob Dubh - first, take the right branch in the path, continuing up steeply to reach a cairn at point 902m. From here there is a view along the ridge towards Stob Dubh, as well as down to the Lairig Gartain below the parallel ridge of Buachaille Etive Mòr .\n\nThe ridge narrows considerably at this point, giving a fine traverse, before the final sharper ascent up to the summit cone of Stob Dubh.\n\nIt is worth continuing a short distance beyond the highest summit cairn to reach a second cairn with a sensational view into Glen Etive and to Loch Etive receding into the infinite distance. Ben Starav looks very impressive to the left side of the loch, whilst in perfect weather the keen eye may pick out the Paps of Jura.\n\nRetrace your steps all along the ridge back to the bealach. To climb the second Munro, Stob Coire Raineach, continue beyond up a steep and rocky ascent with several variant paths. The climb up to the summit cairn is rough but relatively short in distance. From here there is a stunning prospect down Glen Coe.\n\nTo the east and north east the tangle of peaks is lessened by the vastness of Rannoch Moor. The Blackwater Reservoir is very prominent.\n\nReturn once more down to the bealach; care is needed with navigation to ensure a return by the ascent route if visibility is poor as several apparent paths lead onto the steep and difficult craggy terrain of the western slopes.

    "description": "Park in the large car park half way up Glen Coe at NN170569; alternatively you can park in a smaller car park a couple of hundred metres further down the glen. The car park is often busy with coaches later in the day (and often has a bagpiper), so try to arrive fairly early. There is a fabulous view of the Three Sisters across the glen; the walk begins by climbing between Gear Aonach and Aonach Dubh. Begin by following the path down from the car park to the old track in the bottom of the glen; turn right along this track briefly and then left on the path heading down to the footbridge over the River Coe and up into Coire nan Lochan.\n\nThe excellent path climbs steadily up into Coire nan Lochan, keeping high on the left side of the valley. Much of the path surface has been improved by 'pitching' in recent years; only at one point where the path comes closer to the stream is there a rockier section requiring some simple scrambling. There are waterfalls down the valley floor and good views back down into Glen Coe, whilst the peak of Stob Coire nan Lochan is prominent ahead. Much higher up there is a small waterfall by a boulder; fork right here onto a fainter path (the main path leads up via the east ridge of Stob Coire nan Lochan - more direct but less scenic). Cross the burn and a boggier section of the path. It becomes faint on a climb up grassy ground to the west and then southwest into the upper coire. The great Pinnacle and South Buttresses of Stob Coire nan Lochan tower above here.\n\nHead northwest to gain the foot of Stob Coire nan Lochan's north ridge. Turn left up the ridge towards the summit. Although this ridge looked as jagged as a toast-rack from below, the buttresses projected out from the true ridge line and the ascent of the ridge is simply a walk on boulders, with great views down the cliffs and gullies to the left.\n\nThe top of Stob Coire nan Lochan is then reached; this peak is 1115 metres but its close connection to Bidean nam Bian means it doesn't qualify as a separate Munro. The lower section of the ridge leading up to Bidean looks intimidatingly steep from here but proves easier on close acquaintance Head down to the bealach between the peaks on gentle scree and then follow the path which keeps a little to the left on the steep section.\n\nThe summit of Bidean nam Bian is the highest in Argyll at 1150 metres. The view is superb in all directions, from Loch Etive in the southwest, passing round over a section of sea with Mull beyond, to Beinn a'Bheithir above Ballachulish and over the Aonach Eagach to Ben Nevis.\n\nThe walk continues along the fine ridge which leads towards Bidean's second Munro, Stob Coire Sgreamhach. The ridge has tremendous scenery all around and crosses a couple of minor summits; there are steep butresses falling to the north side giving real depth to the views.\n\nEventually the ridge descends to Bealach Dearg; there is a path throughout and no real difficulties. Beyond the bealach the ridge rises once more, with one steeper section of boulders to negotiate, before the summit of Stob Coire Sgreamhach is reached. At 1072 metres, this peak was promoted in 1997 to become Bidean nam Bian's second Munro summit. Again, the views are superb, especially over Buachaille Etive Beag and Buachaille Etive Mòr , and along the length of Loch Etive with Ben Starav towering above and Ben Cruachan beyond. Return to the Bealach Dearg.\n\nDescend north from the bealach into Coire Gabhail - note that a large snow patch can cover this route even well into summer. The scree gully leading down is very eroded, but there is a 'path' of sorts which descends the broken rocks just to the right of the gully on the first section; after that there is a path winding down the scree. Further down the path has been much improved in recent years, and keeps to the left side of the coire, well above the stream which flows in a gorge. At the far end of the Coire is the flat area known as the 'Lost Valley'. This was used to hide rustled cattle by the Macdonald's of Glencoe. The stream itself has been buried under rocks fallen from the mountains above; some of the boulders at the far end of the valley are as big as houses.\n\nThe path out of the Lost Valley is on the right, and climbs above the valley floor on the lower flanks of Beinn Fhada. Follow this clear path which ascends a little before descending once more on sections of pitched footpath. There is one section of easy scrambling down a rake with a steep drop on the left; this can be avoided if preferred by climbing over the end of the boulder directly ahead. Beyond this the path descends and crosses the stream on stepping stones, before taking a brief section of new path above the gorge and continuing down, eventually crossing the river on a bridge high above the waters. The path then leads back through birch woodland to the wider Glen Coe track, a short distance below the car park at the start.",

Take the track which continues towards Fersit - signed as a right of way to Corrour Station. The track passes houses and crosses a bridge over the river and then railway. Keep right at a fork to pass between the houses of Fersit. At another fork go right, following the track that climbs up and passes to the right of a large metal barn. Pass through a gate onto the open moorland ground, and continue along the track until a branch on the right heads for a hut and pens.\n\nFrom here strike off southwards towards Stob Coire Sgriodain; there are various bits of path but generally the going is rough and very boggy.\n\nAim directly towards the steep nose of Sròn na Garbh-bheinne across the moor. As the ascent gets steeper several gullys cut across the slope from left heading up to the right; you can use these to aid progress at times, but generally just keep heading up until the rocky nose is gained. There are stunning views across to the Easains.\n\nContinue along a ridge section SSW before turning to make the final ascent up rocky slopes towards Stob Coire Sgriodain itself. The summit is a magnificent viewpoint, with Coire Sgriodain dropping very steeply away to the west giving tremendous depth to the views of Loch Treig, and beyond to the Mamores and the peaks of Glencoe.\n\nFollow a path down into the cleft of Glac Bhan, and continue the traverse over rocky ground covering point 958m. Eventually the stones relent and the route continues over smooth mossy slopes onto Chno Dearg. There are views to the lochan down in the coire to the left.\n\nIgnore traces of a grassy ATV route cutting across the west slopes of Chno Dearg, instead aiming up the smooth slopes towards the summit. Looking back, the outlying top of Meall Garbh reveals the hidden cliffs of Creagan Coire nan Cnamh.\n\nThe summit of Chno Dearg is marked by a huge cairn, and good views particularly over Loch Laggan, though they lack the drama of the view from Stob Coire Sgriodain.\n\nThe descent is down stony ground at first, but the going soon becomes boggy once more, down wet and featureless slopes.

    "description": "The walk begins from a rough layby on the N side of the A85 by Falls of Cruachan railway station (small sign). If full, it is no longer possible to park at the Power Station Visitor Centre, but there is a proper layby about 700m further along the road towards Oban, on the right hand side. From the Railway Station sign walk up the path and then under the railway line via an underpass. Climb the concrete steps up the other side that lead to the left of an electric substation. Look out for a path heading off left through the trees. Continue on this path as it meanders through the oak, birch and hazel wood, climbing steeply in places. The Allt Cruachan can be heard flowing down the little gorge on the left. There are occasional views out over Loch Awe.\n\nAfter the trees thin out, the path leads over a stile at a deer fence and then continues uphill, soon emerging at a surfaced track. Turn left and cross a bridge over the stream and continue up the track to reach the Cruachan dam, which is very imposing at close quarters.\n\nHere turn left up the zig zag path and then climb the metal staircase onto the dam itself. Turn left to cross the rest of the dam and immediately take the path on the right to short cut to the track heading round the west side of the reservoir. Follow the track along the side of the reservoir until you reach the end. Before the end of the track a small cairn marks a path heading up to the left. However this path is the boggier of the two and it is better to continue over the stream and then climb immediately left on the second, clearer path.\n\nThe path climbs up the glen, becoming steep and eroded to reach the upper level of Coire Dearg. From here it levels briefly before another short and steep pull up an eroded stony path to the bealach, where there is a small lochan. From the bealach follow the eroded stony path to the right which climbs towards the summit of Cruachan. The path soon becomes lost as the arduous climb continues up stones and boulders.\n\nThe summit is marked by a cairn and the stump of a former trig point. At 1,126 metres this is the highest peak for miles around, and the views are fantastic, particularly down over Loch Etive, and out to the west to the prominent pointed summit of Taynuilt Peak (a 'Top' of Ben Cruachan) and the sea and islands beyond. But most attention, perhaps, will be looking along the grand rocky ridge stretching ahead.\n\nHead along the fine ridge which is rocky in places; looking back the summit peak of Cruachan looks very impressive. After the first dip, the route crosses a series of easy rock slabs before climbing back to the crest via a gully (they can be bypassed to the right, but this loses some height). The ridge then continues, rocky in places, with good views in all directions.\n\nA steeper climb leads almost to the summit of Drochaid Ghlas. The highest point lies just off the main ridgeline to the north but a short detour can be made to the top. Otherwise turn right just before the top of Drochaid Ghlas at a cairn to make a loose and steep descent on a clear path. From here on the ridge is a pleasant walk with a steep pull up to the summit of Stob Dàimh, with great views back to the peaked summit of Ben Cruachan. At the Stob Dàimh cairn - the second munro of the day - the clear horseshoe route from the Dalmally side can be seen.\n\nHead south from here along a clear ridge, crossing a bealach before the slight climb to Stob Garbh. After this the route descends gradually towards the bealach at the Lairig Torran. The route now becomes pathless for a time; aim WSW, keeping to the right of a burn and heading down the grassy slopes.\n\nFurther down a clearer path is picked up. Follow this; eventually it crosses the burn and traverses boggy ground above the reservoir to meet a track at the end of a tunnel carrying water through the mountain. Follow the track uphill slightly and then down, passing the dam; keep left. Continue down to the point where the road forks; turn right here and follow the track briefly until the outward route heads off to the left. Rejoin this and retrace your steps back down the rugged path to and through the woods to return to the railway station and the start of the walk.",

The view of the mountain from here is still impressive but not as daunting as that from Kinghouse - the route of ascent up Coire na Tulaich is clearly visible. Start by following the track down to the footbridge, cross it and bear right on the path to reach Lagangarbh hut.\n\nThe Scottish Mountaineering Club hut (locked) at Lagangarbh is remembered in climbing folklore as where the brilliant but rebellious young climber Dougal Haston enraged the staid SMC authorities by redecorating the interior in the style of Jackson Pollock, but unfortunately no sign of this paint job remains. Continue up the moor for a few hundred metres to a fork in the path; keep right here (the left branch is the rock-climber's path to the foot of the cliffs). The path, much improved in recent years, climbs ever more steeply and crosses the Allt Coire na Tulaich to continue its ascent into the coire up the far bank. There are good views across to Buachaille Etive Beag.\n\nTowards the top of the corrie the path veers right and threads a way up boulderfields well to the right of the central scree chute. Higher up the path cuts back left and then climbs up a rocky rib to reach the bealach. In winter conditions this route is banked out by snow and the very steep coire headwall makes it a notorious blackspot for avalanches. Whatever the season, it will most likely be a relief when the ridge is suddenly reached. Turn left up the unexpectedly broad, bouldery ridge; this narrows only as the summit cairn is approached.\n\nA cairn marks the summit of Stob Dearg, the highest of the two Munros on the Buachaille at 1022 metres. The view is magnificent in all directions, with perhaps the most impressive feature being the great void beyond the summit as the cliffs plunge down suddenly to the completely bleak flatness of Rannoch Moor. This view is particularly striking when the mountain casts a great triangular shadow out across the moor.\n\nReturn along the ridge to the top of the route up Coire na Tulaich. This time continue straight along the ridge towards Stob na Doire.\n\nThe path ascends slightly before curving to the left and climbing to the top of Stob na Doire - a long ascent that has many feeling this 'Top' should be classed as a Munro! Care is needed at the summit in poor visibility, as the terrain has led some walkers to descend southeast from this point; note the turn in the ridge for the descent to the next bealach.\n\nFrom here climb up to Stob Coire Altruim, with a steep crag falling away to your right and great views. Continue along the undulating ridge to the second Munro, Stob na Bròige. This summit, at 956 metres, looks out down Glen Etive, and was promoted to Munro status in 1997. Baggers should be thankful at this change in status as it means they have an excuse (if any were needed) to complete this fabulous walk along the ridge.\n\nReturn along the ridge almost as far as the bealach before Stob na Doire. From here, descend on a constructed path down the slopes to the north, keeping to the west bank of the Allt Coire Altruim. The path is good at first but lower down there is some very rocky going with minor scrambling, requiring some care.\n\nAt the foot of the glen cross the stream to join the path through the Lairig Gartain. Turn right onto this footpath, and follow it right back to the A82. The path has been expertly built and gives good going. Once at the road there is about a kilometre of the dangerously busy A82 between you and the start at Altnafeadh - it is best to keep to the right of the road on traces of a very boggy path. When driving back south on the A82 the Buachaille looks incredibly formidable and it is hard to believe that you've just been up there.",

Ben Starav looks very impressive to the left side of the loch, whilst in perfect weather the keen eye may pick out the Paps of Jura.\n\nRetrace your steps all along the ridge back to the bealach. To climb the second Munro, Stob Coire Raineach, continue beyond up a steep and rocky ascent with several variant paths. The climb up to the summit cairn is rough but relatively short in distance. From here there is a stunning prospect down Glen Coe.\n\nTo the east and north east the tangle of peaks is lessened by the vastness of Rannoch Moor. The Blackwater Reservoir is very prominent.\n\nReturn once more down to the bealach; care is needed with navigation to ensure a return by the ascent route if visibility is poor as several apparent paths lead onto the steep and difficult craggy terrain of the western slopes. Once down at the bealach, retrace your steps back down the well constructed path into the Lairig Èilde and back to the start.",

    "summary": "Stob Ghabhar is the finest of the Black Mount summits, its narrow rocky ridges and steep sides standing out amongst the hills of the southern Highlands. Stob a'Choire Odhair is an easier ascent with a magnificent view over Rannoch Moor. Combining both peaks, this route is a fine expedition for experienced hillwalkers.",
    "description": "There is a car park off to the left about 300m before Victoria Bridge on the minor road from Bridge of Orchy. Begin the walk by rejoining the road (there is a shortcut path starting to the left of the pines from the car park). Follow the road (which is also part of the West Highland Way) over the bridge, then turn left onto the track signposted as a Public Footpath to Loch Etive by Glen Kinglas. Follow this track which soon runs along the north bank of the Abhainn Shira, passing beside a plantation.\n\nThe track passes a green metal hut at Clashgour - this was once the local schoolhouse but is now a mountaineering club hut. Just beyond this and before crossing the stream, turn off onto an path on the right. This has a few boggy stretches at first but soon becomes excellent, following the Allt Toaig towards the hills. It leads very pleasantly uphill towards Coire Toaig, sloping uphill away from the stream a little opposite some slabby crags with a waterfall on the mountainside opposite - you may spot the descent path descending to the right of this waterfall. Continue on the main path until just after it crosses the Allt Caolinn Duibh. Here turn right on a path that soon joins an old stalkers' path.\n\nOnce on the stalkers' route there are a series of zig-zags that greatly ease the ascent - you can help prevent erosion here by sticking to the zig-zags. Higher up the ridge becomes indistinct and the path fades on the broad slopes. Continue the ascent to reach the cairn marking the summit of Stob a'Choire Odhar, a Munro at 945m. The views from here are superb in all directions, but particularly stunning is the vast expanse of Rannoch Moor to the north, seemingly as much water as land; this summit is well worthwhile as an easier hillwalk in its own right and less experienced hillwalkers should return the same way from here.\n\nTo continue to Stob Ghabhar, leave the summit by following the broad west ridge down to the bealach at 668 metres. From here follow the path that climbs to the west, keeping left at an indistinct fork. The path now ascends WSW for about three hundred metres.\n\nThe route from here however climbs more directly up the very steep slopes to the south, roughly following the boundary marked on OS maps; there is a path in places but care is needed as the slope is unpleasantly loose with scree and rocks and the view back down towards Coirein Lochain could be intimidating to some; careful navigation is needed. The ridge of Aonach Eagach above is likely to be reached with some relief.\n\nTurn right along the path on the crest of the ridge; there is one very narrow section but no real difficulties - it is a very fine ridge but no rival to its more famous namesake the Aonach Eagach in nearby Glencoe.\n\nAfter crossing a notch a short rocky ascent follows before a cairn is reached (marking the descent route for later). Continue along the ridge as it curves round to reach the final climb up beside a line of fenceposts to the fine summit of Stob Ghabhar at 1087m, close to the very edge of the crags plunging down into the corrie.\n\nReturn the same way for about 500m to a cairn, and from here follow a faint path that decends southwards to reach an old fenceline. The path then follows the fence to join the Stob Maol ridge. This is much broader and gives easier going; lower down curve round to the left towards the stream flowing out of Coire na Muic. The old fenceposts are a guide for much of the way, but make sure you cross the Allt Coire na Muic before reaching the falls at the bottom of the corrie.\n\nOnce on the far side of the burn the ground falls away very steeply in the slabby crags of Creag an Steallaire (the crags of the Falls). A very steep and eroded path - scrambly and requiring great care - descends the north side of the falls, giving fine views of the several cascades. Below this steep section continue down the easier slopes by the stream to reach the Allt Toaig. This needs to be crossed (note this could be difficult in spate) to regain the path used on the outward route. Turn right down this path to retrace your earlier steps back to Victoria Bridge.",

    "description": "Park in the large but often busy layby at Altnafeadh - this is a very popular ascent at weekends. The view of the mountain from here is still impressive but not as daunting as that from Kinghouse - the route of ascent up Coire na Tulaich is clearly visible. Start by following the track down to the footbridge, cross it and bear right on the path to reach Lagangarbh hut.\n\nThe Scottish Mountaineering Club hut (locked) at Lagangarbh is remembered in climbing folklore as where the brilliant but rebellious young climber Dougal Haston enraged the staid SMC authorities by redecorating the interior in the style of Jackson Pollock, but unfortunately no sign of this paint job remains. Continue up the moor for a few hundred metres to a fork in the path; keep right here (the left branch is the rock-climber's path to the foot of the cliffs). The path, much improved in recent years, climbs ever more steeply and crosses the Allt Coire na Tulaich to continue its ascent into the coire up the far bank. There are good views across to Buachaille Etive Beag.\n\nTowards the top of the corrie the path veers right and threads a way up boulderfields well to the right of the central scree chute. Higher up the path cuts back left and then climbs up a rocky rib to reach the bealach. In winter conditions this route is banked out by snow and the very steep coire headwall makes it a notorious blackspot for avalanches. Whatever the season, it will most likely be a relief when the ridge is suddenly reached. Turn left up the unexpectedly broad, bouldery ridge; this narrows only as the summit cairn is approached.\n\nA cairn marks the summit of Stob Dearg, the highest of the two Munros on the Buachaille at 1022 metres. The view is magnificent in all directions, with perhaps the most impressive feature being the great void beyond the summit as the cliffs plunge down suddenly to the completely bleak flatness of Rannoch Moor. This view is particularly striking when the mountain casts a great triangular shadow out across the moor.\n\nReturn along the ridge to the top of the route up Coire na Tulaich. This time continue straight along the ridge towards Stob na Doire.\n\nThe path ascends slightly before curving to the left and climbing to the top of Stob na Doire - a long ascent that has many feeling this 'Top' should be classed as a Munro! Care is needed at the summit in poor visibility, as the terrain has led some walkers to descend southeast from this point; note the turn in the ridge for the descent to the next bealach.\n\nFrom here climb up to Stob Coire Altruim, with a steep crag falling away to your right and great views. Continue along the undulating ridge to the second Munro, Stob na Bròige. This summit, at 956 metres, looks out down Glen Etive, and was promoted to Munro status in 1997. Baggers should be thankful at this change in status as it means they have an excuse (if any were needed) to complete this fabulous walk along the ridge.\n\nReturn along the ridge almost as far as the bealach before Stob na Doire. From here, descend on a constructed path down the slopes to the north, keeping to the west bank of the Allt Coire Altruim. The path is good at first but lower down there is some very rocky going with minor scrambling, requiring some care.\n\nAt the foot of the glen cross the stream to join the path through the Lairig Gartain. Turn right onto this footpath, and follow it right back to the A82. The path has been expertly built and gives good going. Once at the road there is about a kilometre of the dangerously busy A82 between you and the start at Altnafeadh - it is best to keep to the right of the road on traces of a very boggy path. When driving back south on the A82 the Buachaille looks incredibly formidable and it is hard to believe that you've just been up there.",

    "description": "There is a good-sized car park at Aberarder on the north side of the A86, opposite Loch Laggan. Fork left off the track onto the excellent footpath and then ignore two other paths leading off to the left. The footpath crosses a track before reaching the whitewashed former farm which is now part of the National Nature Reserve, run by NatureScot; there are sheltered picnic tables here and a toilet. Continue on the path which soon becomes pitched as it climbs through the fine regenerating birchwoods. At a clear junction, ignore the red pine marten signpost and take the right hand branch which climbs gently.\n\nAfter around 1.5km from the car park, a stone-pitched path heads off amongst the birch trees on the right. This well constructed path climbs up through the woods. Continue up the rough hillside to just west of Na Cnapanan, with great views back over Loch Laggan.\n\nFrom here continue northwest - a branch path leads off, making for a long grind up the broad hillside, which becomes stonier near the summit. There are excellent views across to the great crags of Creag Meagaidh behind Coire Àrdair, relieving the monotony of the slope. The angle eases eventually onto a broad ridge, and the summit of Càrn Liath is marked by a large cairn. This is the first Munro of the day at a height of 1006 metres. Head west down the open slopes and over the insignificant swelling of Meall an t-Snaim.\n\nFrom here the slopes begin to narrow to form a ridge, and old iron rusty fence posts point the way towards the peculiar trench-like bealach of Uinneas Min Choire. There is a short, steep little ascent from here to reach Sròn Coire a'Chriochairein. From here the ridge becomes much better defined, with steep drops to the left and stunning views.\n\nCurve round the edge of the corrie and then continue west along the flat summit ridge to reach the summit cairn of Stob Poite a'Choire Àrdair beyond. This is the second Munro at 1053 metres. Descend south southwest to reach 'The Window', the bealach between the ridge just traversed and Creag Meagaidh itself. 'The Window' is set well back from Coire Àrdair and there is no view down to the lochan. Follow the path which climbs up the far side. If joining the route at this point following an ascent from the lochan, be sure to head to the west end of the Window, as a faint path heading up Creag Meagaidh from the east end is uncomfortably steep.\n\nThe slope soon eases into the vast plateau of Creag Meagaidh. Cross this to a giant, very old looking cairn on the northern fringe of the tablelands beyond - Mad Meg's cairn. This isn't the summit of the mountain though; for this, continue westwards where the plateau soon narrows to form a ridge. A short ascent along this ridge brings the cairn of Creag Meagaidh into view. This is the highest mountain in the area at 1130 metres, and the views are very extensive on a clear day. From here, return across the plateau and back down to 'The Window'.\n\nDescend the steep slopes leading east from the Window; the path is steep, stony and eroded and keeps to the left on the way down at first, before switching to the right on the second steep section. Further down it becomes grassier.\n\nThe scenery becomes ever more impressive as height is lost until Lochan Coire Àrdair is reached. This tiny sheet of water is utterly overpowered by the great bulk of Creag Meagaidh's cliffs high above. This is regarded as one of the best ice-climbing arenas in Scotland. From the lochan there is a clear path down the north bank of the Allt Coire Àrdair. The path is a little boggy at first but improves further down where it keeps further from the river. The lower part of the glen is clothed with a wonderful remnant of the ancient forest, and further still are the regenerating areas helped by the National Nature Reserve. Continue down the path right back to the start.",

Ben Vorlich is a very popular hillwalk from Loch Earn and a fine viewpoint, whilst the continuation to Stùc a' Chròin is a more serious walk with steep, rocky ground.",
    "description": "There is rough informal parking on the verges of the minor road along the south side of Loch Earn, mostly just west of the hump-backed bridge over the Ardvorlich burn. The walk begins up the track on the opposite (east) side of the burn, passing between the urn-topped stone gateposts. Keep right at the fork below the farm cottages, crossing the bridge back to the west side of the burn. Ardvorlich House is seen ahead here, but instead turn left once over the bridge.\n\nThe track leads over stiles next to several gates. After about a kilometre and a half there is fork in the track. Take the main route to the right which continues the ascent. A little further on, cross the Allt a'Choire Bhuidhe via a footbridge; here the track ends and the route becomes a path.\n\nThis first part of the path has been much improved in recent years. It continues the climb, now across open heather slopes, towards the north side of Ben Vorlich. As height is gained the path becomes increasingly eroded as it leads up the Sgiath nam Tarmachan ridge (wings of the ptarmigan). A final steeper climb half left leads up towards the summit ridge.\n\nThe trig point is at 985 metres, with the cairn a little further east along the fine ridge being slightly lower. The position of Ben Vorlich on the southern edge of the Highlands - combined with the steepness of the slopes falling away from the summit - ensures it a superb viewpoint for much of central Scotland. For most visitors, this summit will be enough; they should return the same way.\n\nExperienced Munro-baggers may want to include Stùc a' Chròin. This is a much rockier and trickier peak, and is well seen from Ben Vorlich. To include it, follow the ridge path west at first and then curve round on it to the left to descend to the intervening bealach. From here the usual route follows the path to the bottom of the steep prow of Stùc a' Chròin, then ascending a short boulder field.\n\nA path then bears slightly right - aim for a slabby rock which can be ascended via a gully along its left edge. There are steep zig-zagging paths heading up the slope above, keeping to the right of the main buttress - care is necessary to ensure you stay on route, which ends abruptly at a cairn on the top of the prow. This section is for expert mountaineers only in winter. It is possible to avoid this ascent by descending into the coire from the bealach, descending a little into the corrie on the west side before climbing the still-steep path that zigzags up a grassy slope between the broken rocks. From there the northwest ridge can be followed to rejoin the main route at the top of the prow. From here there are great views back to Ben Vorlich.\n\nThe summit of Stùc a' Chròin is a half kilometre further south along the ridge; there are two cairns, with the higher summit being the smaller northern one. With its position on the southern edge of the Highlands, it offers unrivalled views over Scotland's central belt - a remarkable contrast to the view to the north. To the northwest Lochearnhead is seen, whilst Loch Voil can be spotted over to the west.\n\nFor the return route, the prow can be avoided on a path on the west side that keeps just below the rockier gound. Once the ridge coming down from the prow is reached at around 850m carefully take the very steep path that zig-zags down the grassy slope to the northeast. Once easier terrain is reached below the path becomes boggier and not so obvious, but in clear conditions this boggy trod contours the slopes keeping just below the ridge linking the two Munros, continuing right around to reach the NW ridge of Ben Vorlich at around 680m.\n\nA very eroded and boggy path now continues contouring, this time around the head of Coire Buidhe, before losing height as it gradually converges with and rejoins the ascent path back down to Loch Earn.",

    "description": "Take the minor road that branches off Glen Lyon to head up to the Giorra Dam of Loch an Dàimh (which means the Loch of the Stag, not of the Dam!). There is parking just before the bridge over the river below the dam. Begin the walk by crossing the bridge and following the track which climbs up to the south end of the dam. The dam was built and the present loch created in the early 1960s as part of the Breadalbane hydroelectric scheme.\n\nA couple of hundred metres further along the track is a cairn marking the start of the path up Stuchd an Lochain. This climbs across the slope for some distance until almost directly above the boathouse on the shores of the reservoir.\n\nThe path continues very steeply up towards the ridge and is wet and eroded in places. The recompense is in the improving views back down over the dam. Continue the ascent to the south-southwest until the broad east ridge of Creag an Fheadain is reached.\n\nTurn right and follow the now much drier hill path. There is a short steeper section before the flat top of Creag an Fheadain, which has a couple of cairns. The summit of Stuchd an Lochain now comes into view for the first time, with Loch an Dàimh seen to its right. The ridge now leads SSW and descends to a slight bealach before climbing once more, this time to the Top of Sròn a'Chona Choirein.\n\nContinue west across the almost flat plateau. From the rim of the cliffs of Coire an Lochain Stuchd an Lochain looks its very finest, rising drmatically from the attractive and almost circular Lochan nan Cat. After a slight descent the final climb towards the summit begins. The fenceposts go left just before the summit cairn, which is close to the edge of the crags.\n\nAlthough it may be a relatively modest hill in terms of the giants of the area, the mountain has a strategic position and the view is very extensive. Ben Lawers dominates to the southeast, but the finest outlook is from a few paces beyond the cairn to bring into view the head of Loch an Dàimh, with Rannoch Moor and then - if the day is clear - the peaks of Glen Coe and Ben Nevis beyond.\n\nThe most straightforward route of return is to retrace your steps; descents to the reservoir are not recommended as the shore gives very hard going.

    "description": "Park at the Glenshee Ski Centre; there is a car park by the cafe on the west side of the road, and a much larger parking area on the east side for use in the skiing season, there is a charge. Begin the walk from the cafe by heading past the main ski building and then turning left across a gravelled yard to join a track climbing steeply uphill. Follow this diagonally to the right to reach a ski-lift and an octagonal cafe building (used in winter only). Continue on the main track between two ski-lifts, climbing steeply uphill. The track then bends left and crosses over a ski-run. Once past the far snow fence turn right onto a slightly narrower, eroded track climbing steeply. This eventually recrosses a ski-run; when it forks take the left branch which aims straight uphill.\n\nThe track climbs to reach the ridge just west of Càrn Aosda (with a Càrn Aosda signpost). Ignore the track cutting across the slope to the right and instead head straight uphill on a stony path to soon reach the summit cairn. At 917 metres in height and with the high level start this is probably the easiest of all Munros to reach. Unfortunately the extensive ski developments badly scar its slopes and detract from the experience, though the views are good.\n\nReturn to the track junction where you first met the summit ridge, and this time continue ahead along the ridge. Follow the track as it passes the top of the ski runs and eventually descends to a bealach above Loch Vrotachan. Here the track swings left and begins to climb once more.\n\nBefore reaching the next minor summit, take a narrow path off to the right to cut across the slopes and reach a second bealach, marked 808m on OS maps. Cross this bealach - with the ski developments now out of sight and mind - and climb the path up the grassy slope beyond. This continues round above the broken crags of Creag a'Choire Dhirich and passes a couple of small lochans before reaching the small plateau Càrn nan Sac.\n\nContinue along the now flater, featureless ridge, beyond which is a final short climb to the cairn. This is Càrn a'Ghèoidh, the highest of the three peaks at 975 metres, and unlike the other two it does have a feeling of remoteness and escape. Glas Tulaichean and its graceful ridges dominate the view to the west.\n\nFrom here, retrace your steps back to the 808m bealach below the Aosda - Cairnwell ridge. From here take the path which climbs opposite onto the ridge and then gain the track just beyond. Turn right up this, soon passing the top of the chairlift.\n\nBeyond is the summit of the Cairnwell, the third Munro at 933 metres and crowned with ugly transmitter masts, buildings and a makeshift shelter. It is worth continuing a little beyond in order to enjoy a grand view down Glen Shee with no distractions.\n\nFrom here the easiest descent is to head back down the ridge track, continuing to the 795m bealach below Carn Aosda and then following a good track to the right which descends the corrie and rejoins the outward route above the octagonal cafe. It is also possible to make a more direct descent nearer to the chairlift, but this is steeper and is over rough and pathless ground.",

It is also exceptionally remote and arduous; many will break the route with an overnight stay at Corrour bothy. This can be approached either from the Linn of Dee to the south leaving a very long return, or via the Chalamain Gap from the Sugar Bowl car park on Speyside - the latter route making the traverse possible in a single epic day for the extremely fit.",
    "description": "The most convenient start point is the Sugar Bowl car park on the left at the foot of the zig-zags on the Cairngorm ski road (long alternatives which avoid the Chalamain Gap include Whitewell and Loch Morlich). Cross the road and follow the path down to a footbridge over the Allt Mòr in a ravine. On the far side bear right uphill and then back left onto a paved path that keeps to the north of the stream for a couple of kilometres with good views before it dips to cross the now small stream once more. Beyond the path continues, climbing gradually towards the obvious little rocky pass ahead - the Chalamain Gap.\n\nBefore reaching this the path vanishes as the gap is floored by rough, awkward boulders. Progress through the gap is slow and care is needed - this is a potential leg-breaker. The terrain thankfully eases once more on the far side as the path slopes downhill to the south southwest towards the great cleft of the Lairig Ghru. Soon the path descends more steeply down to a burn, joining a path coming up from Rothiemurchus Forest. Turn left here and follow the path which soon crosses the burn at a rocky section.\n\nFollow the path up the glen into the remarkable deep trench of the Lairig Ghru, filled with hummocky morraines left behind by the ice-age. This is Scotland's most famous hill pass, climbing to almost three thousand feet between two of the highest mountains in the land. The great broken cliffs of Lurcher's Crag wall the left side at first, and soon the walls of Sròn na Lairig on the right become just as impressive. At the top of the pass, if the weather is clear, the summits of Cairn Toul and the Devil's Point come into view for the first time. The path is lost as the route continues over several stony morains, passing the Pools of Dee - one of the two sources of the mighty river that flows to Aberdeen. Keep to the left side of the stream on the descent, crossing the foot of the slopes of mighty Ben Macdui, as the branch to the right heads into the great super-corrie of An Garbh Coire.\n\nContinue following the path southwards, with terrific views into Garbh Choire on the right - the great rim of the cliffs far above is the route followed later in the walk. After almost four kilometres from the pools the Clach nan Taillear is reached. The name means the Stone of the Tailors and according to local legend it was behind this rock that a group of tailors died in a blizzard when crossing the Lairig as part of a wager. Follow the path for almost another kilometre before turning right onto a branch path that crosses a bridge over the river Dee to reach lonely Corrour bothy. Unless attempting to complete the walk in a single epic day, this open shelter - or a tent pitched at a good distance from it - is the most likely spot to spend the night. The bothy is maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting.\n\nFrom Corrour bothy, the great rocky boss of the Devil's Point looks formidable. To reach it, take the path that climbs up close by the Allt a 'Choire Odhair into the high corrie. The headwall is ascended by means of a zig-zag path - often blocked by hard snow well into the summer. The climb ends very suddenly as the route emerges onto the wide, spacious bealach beyond. The Devil's Point - so impressive from lower down the glen - is reached easily by a detour to the left from here, with less than a hundred metres of further ascent. Return to the bealach and begin the much longer climb up the wide, windswept slopes to the northwest, reaching the summit of Stob Coire an t-Saighdeir at the very edge of the steep corrie of the same name.\n\nContinue around the rim of the corrie, descending gently before a final steeper climb up a boulderfield to the summit ridge of Cairn Toul. This bouldery summit is the fourth highest in Britain - and the most remote of the four, with an elegant outline from many directions. The views are superb, especially northwest over the great gulf of Coire an Lochain with its fine lochan to the mighty summit of Braeriach. The route turns west here and descends over boulders, this time with the cliffs of Coire an Lochain falling vertically on the right.\n\nAfter crossing a bealach the route climbs again, now on easier terrain, to reach Sgòr an Lochain Uaine - also known as the Angel's Peak. A twin to Cairn Toul, Sgòr an Lochain Uaine was promoted to become a separate Munro in 1997. Its northeast ridge is a fine scramble but our traverse continues along the headwalls of the cliffs, descending to another bealach - with great views looking back - before climbing to Càrn na Criche above the great buttresses of Garbh Choire Mòr .\n\nAt this point the route flattens off into a truly vast plateau. Head east northeast, keeping away from the crags, to reach the second branch of the infant river Dee. Amazingly, at an altitude of 1200 metres, this is already a fast-flowing stream. Cross it and make a bee-line across the featureless plateau towards Braeriach. The summit of this mountain - the highest on the route - is on the very edge of the great gulf of Coire Bhrochain - with perhaps the finest crags on the walk plunging away at one's feet. For this reason it can be very dangerous to navigate towards the cairn in winter conditions in poor visibility - in which case a good distance should be kept from the plateau edge. The views are superb, both over the great forests of Speyside and back across all the corries of the Garbh Choire complex to Cairn Toul, and across the Lairig to Ben Macdui.\n\nContinue along the corrie edge before bearing left and descending to a bealach and then up onto the Sròn na Lairig ridge. Follow the path that descends northwards along this ridge, eventually passing close to the edge of the steep crags that plunge back down to the Lairig Ghru and across to Lurcher's Crag opposite. Continue on the path to the north until it descends to rejoin the Lairig path once the terrain becomes easier. Cross the stream once more and then follow the outward path when it branches right, climbing once more towards the Chalamain Gap. Pass through the gap - a sore trial on the boulders at the end of an epic route - and retrace your steps back to the Sugar Bowl car park.",

    "summary": "The Saddle is the finest of the Kintail peaks and one of the most magnificent mountains in the Highlands. Its ascent via the Forcan Ridge is a difficult but classic scramble; the scrambling can be avoided if needed and the walk still has fantastic views.",
    "description": "Park at the layby on the north side of the A87(T) about three hundred metres east of where a track goes off the road to Achnagart Farm. Cross the road (carefully) and walk east along it until reaching the foot of the stalkers path leading up to the col between Biod an Fhithich and Meallan Odhar. This excellent path winds two and fro up the hillside before making a long traverse to reach the col.\n\nFrom the col, turn left. The path traverses to the right hand side of the summit of Meallan Odhar, reaching the ridge once more between that peak and the foot of the Forcan ridge. When the path begins to climb steeply towards the first rocky steps, a choice must be made as regards whether to tackle the Forcan ridge or avoid it. If avoiding the ridge, turn left here and contour the slope, keeping just to the right of a drystone dyke; this leads up to the Bealach Coire Mhalagain. Otherwise, continue on the main path directly up to the Forcan Ridge.\n\nThe scrambling is simple at first, but the ridge becomes progressively more exposed. Some sections are a real knife-edge, but there is a worn scrambling path which avoids the rocks by keeping just to the right at several points. The exposure is however considerable. After passing the top of Sgùrr na Forcan there is an awkward steep descent of a pitch of about 10 metres; this can be avoided using a gully to the left or a rake to the right. Beyond this the ridge leads over a minor top to ridge the summit of the Saddle, at 1010 metres. The trig point is slightly further along the ridge\n\nTo descend to Bealach Coire Mhalagain, head a short distance south of the trig point to where a path can be seen beginning to make the descent. It winds clearly and steeply at first before petering out in the boulder fields further down. Beyond the boulder fields a boggy traverse eastwards leads to the Bealach. If you have reached here by the drystone dyke, avoiding the Forcan Ridge, use the descent route just described to reach the summit of the Saddle.\n\nTo continue to Sgùrr na Sgìne, there is a sketchy path which winds up the rocky slopes beyond. It is a stiff climb, but you should reach the ridge without too much difficulty. Turn south along the ridge, easily reaching the northwest top of Sgùrr na Sgìne. From here, the ridge becomes very rocky on the continuation to the main summit which is perched above a steep face at 946 metres; the second Munro of the day.\n\nReturn over the northwest top and continue along the ridge to its elegant termination at the minor summit of Faochag. This peak has a dramatic outline when seen from higher up Glen Shiel. The descent is directly down the northeast ridge, which looks impossible from some viewpoints. Closer inspection reveals that - although unremittingly steep - there is a rough, often wet path that aids the tiring descent the whole way down to the glen, with views of the great wall of the Five Sisters opposite. Cross the Allt Mhalagain at the foot of the ridge (or continue on the west bank if this is impossible) and walk up to the road. You are now only about half a kilometre from the layby and the start.",

From the car park a constructed path heads into the woods, soon joining the hydro track up the east side of the Abhainn Gleann nam Fiadh; turn right up this. There are some fine old Scots pines close by the course of the burn and good views back over the Loch, which is actually a reservoir created as part of the 1960s hydroelectric developments.\n\nAfter just over two kilometres another track joins in from the right; follow the main track which curves round to the left. A gate leads through a deer fence. There are grand views of Toll a' Creagach ahead, whilst the steep rocky slopes on the right side are those of Beinn Eun, a shoulder of Toll Creagach. After reaching a hydro intake, the track becomes a very boggy path as it continues up the glen. Two burns coming down from the right - Allt a' Choire Odhair and then the Allt Toll Easa - both need to be crossed, and could be impassable in spate.\n\nAfter crossing the Allt Toll Easa, turn right onto a stalkers path that climbs up parallel to the west bank of the burn, giving views over some fine waterslides. Higher up the path zigzags briefly before the gradient eases as the hanging-valley upper section of the stream is reached. Here the path forks again; you can continue ahead by the burn right up to the bealach, but the better route turns left to follow the more obvious path up onto the Creag na h-Inghinn ridge. The ridge gives a rockier, steeper ascent but there are no real difficulties.\n\nEventually the gradient eases and the route continues above the steep eastern corrie to reach the large summit cairn of Tom a' Chòinich. The views are excellent - and strongly contrasting between the view west along the ridge to the mountainous ground of Càrn Eige and its neighbours, and east out to the much more rounded Toll Creagach and the Firths of the east coast beyond.\n\nA path leads down the initially steep and rocky east ridge to reach the Bealach Toll Easa at 872m. The photo shows the view looking back up the ridge to Tom a' Chòinich.\n\nThe climb on the far side is much more gentle, leading up to the rounded mossy slopes of point 951m. The route continues across a slight dip before the final ascent to the summit of Toll Creagach.\n\nThere is a well-built summit cairn, and a trig point that appears to be slightly lower just beyond. The trig gives the best viewpoint though, looking down over Loch Mullardoch and out east towards the Beauly and Moray Firths.\n\nThe easiest descent is to head directly southwards. Keep to the west of the slight swelling of Beinn Eun as the slopes below it are very steep and also lead to a deer fence. Instead descend more easily to return to Gleann nam Fiadh and regain the outward path. Have one last look up the glen to Tom a'Chòinich before turning left and continuing back to the start.",

    "description": "There is a car park (charge) off the A93 on the south side of the bridge over the Callater Burn by Auchallater Farm The walk begins up the track. This is part of the historic route known as Jock's Road, heading over the hills from Braemar to Glen Doll. The track goes through a gate and soon bends to the right to enter the barren lower reaches of Glen Callater. Interest is added by the cascading river. Jock's Road has a key place in the history of Scottish Access. When Duncan MacPherson bought Glen Doll estate in the late 19th century he tried to ban all access. One John Winter ('Jock') fought for the right to walk this old drove route; legal action went as far as the House of Lords and bankrupted both MacPherson and the Scottish Rights of Way Society. The case led to the passing of the Scottish Rights of Way Act, the most important piece of access legislation until the more recent Land Reform Act of 2005 granted increased rights.\n\nThere are good views back to Ben Avon, identifiable by the line of granite tors along its summit. At one point there is a small quarry on the left and a smaller track going off to the right; continue on the main route. As the fences and buildings at Callater Lodge come into view the track forks again; this time take the left branch. A path goes off to the left by the fence - this is an old stalkers path that leads eventually to Lochnagar; instead pass through the gate and between the shooting lodge and the bothy of Callater Stable. The bothy is maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothy Association; please help by carrying out any rubbish you find here, and always follow the bothy code when visiting. From here the route continues along the line of Jock's Road, but from this point it is a path; cross a small footbridge and then a stile to reach the northern shores of Loch Callater, with Tolmount visible at the head of the glen.\n\nThe path is well maintained and keeps to the shores of the loch, giving excellent views. Pass the head of the loch and keep on up the glen, crossing several small streams via stepping stones. Once below the steep crags on the left the path becomes wet underfoot, before improving a little as it crosses the rougher ground above the green flats. Further on there are views up into dramatic Corrie Kander high on the other side of the glen; from this point Jock's Road becomes very boggy and hard to follow. Continue up the glen, passing beneath the crags of Creag Leachdach. Beyond these Jock's Road finally begins to climb out of the valley, aiming for the lowest and easiest escape on the eastern side; the climb is quite steep for a few hundred metres.\n\nOnce the easier gradients of the plateau are reached leave Jock's Road and bear right, contouring round towards Tolmount. The ascent is straightforward, ending at a cairn at 958 metres but set too far back from the craggy north face to have any depth to the view down Glen Callater. Tolmount may be a Munro but it is surrounded by higher peaks on all sides, with Lochnagar and Broad Cairn the most prominent to the northeast, and the most impressive part of the view is the emptiness of the plateau. This is no place to be during a storm, particularly in winter.\n\nTom Buidhe is the pudding of a hill visible across a depression to the south. To reach it, it is easiest to maintain height by bearing right at first and then crossing where there is less descent before curving left to the summit, which is almost the same height as Tolmount at 957m; reaching this second Munro of the day is very easy if conditions are good and usually takes less than thirty minutes. Now you must decide on the return route. The quickest way back is to retrace your steps, skirting the top of Tolmount and heading back down Jock's Road. If conditions are good and you have the energy, there is an alternative which makes the route a circuit (times given for the walk assume the circuit). This heads back towards the bealach with Tolmount at first, then climbing across the slopes of Cairn of Claise, aiming for the bealach between that hill and Càrn an Tuirc. Take great care to avoid walking over the precipices that plunge down to Coire Kander; you should be able to find the tumbled remains of a drystone wall and a track at the bealach.\n\nFollow the track as it curves round above Coire Kander, a safe distance back from the edge. The Munro summit of Cairn an Tuirc is only a short distance from here and could easily be included in the walk, as could Cairn of Claise with a little more effort. Otherwise keep to the track, passing a cairn and continuing to curve round the corrie. It then turns to the left and begins the descent, being eroded by vehicles in places. Lower down it skirts round a minor hillock before finally descending back to the lower end of Loch Callater and its lodge. Cross the bridge over the river and then rejoin the outward route, following the track back down Glen Callater to the start.",

    "description": "Park in the car park on the west side of the Abhainn Coire Mhic Nobuil, about three kilometres west of Torridon village. Have a look at the river from the bridge- there are some attractive waterfalls here- before taking the path up the west side of the stream (not the much larger path on the east side).\n\nThe path soon crosses the deer fence at a stile, continuing up the moor to reach the stream issuing from the deep scoop of Coir nan Laogh. Continue up the path into the corrie.\n\nThe clear but rough path zig-zags straightforwardly up the corrie, keeping to the west side of the stream. After a long climb, it emerges on a fairly flat plateau. The triangulation point marking the summit of Tom na Gruagaich, at 922 metres, is soon reached over to the right. This was once a mere Top but in 1997 it was promoted and it is now the lower of Beinn Alligin's two Munros. It is a fabulous viewpoint, with a vast swathe of the sea topped off with the Isle of Skye, whilst to the east, Liathach is seen end-on.\n\nBest of all, however, is the view of the ridgewalk ahead. Head down the narrow north ridge of Tom na Gruagaich, which is steep and rocky in places with some simple scrambling - easier ground is on the left. From the col, climb up over a minor top; beyond this the ridge levels off briefly before beginning the final steeper climb up to Sgùrr Mhor.\n\nShortly before reaching the summit, the ridge is split by the Eag Dubh or Black Cleft, a tremendously dramatic gully on the southeast side. This is easily passed on the left side. Beyond, the second and highest of Beinn Alligin's two Munro summits, Sgùrr Mhòr at 986 metres, is quickly reached.\n\nThis is an even better viewpoint, with Baosbheinn looking fabulous across Loch a Bhealaich to the north; but the pick of the view is that of the incredibly steep peak of Beinn Dearg with the Horns of Alligin as a foreground. If you don't like scrambling or if the weather is poor, you can return from here back the way you came; taking this option would reduce the difficulty of the walk to Grade 4.\n\nDescend the ridge that dips steeply towards the first of the Horns. The three Horns of Alligin, Na Rathanan in Gaelic, are a landmark from many points miles around, and together with the steep domed top of Sgùrr Mhòr make Beinn Alligin easy to identify in distant views. There is a faint path which traverses the very steep grass slopes to the right of the first two horns, but this can be very slippery and is probably more dangerous than climbing over the Horns themselves. Instead follow the path which winds up the first Horn, with some very simple - a rocky staircase. The top is a narrow but level ridge, before a steep descent to the foot of the second Horn. The ascent of this one is short and direct with one steeper scrambling move and little alternative.\n\nThe final Horn has three options; it can be avoided entirely by a bypass path on the right, tackled fairly direct initially before heading right along a ledge and then heading up a chimney, or via a path which makes an ascending traverse to the right and reaches the top via a simple rocky staircase. The descent of the far side is straightforward. The way down then continues for some distance before easing at around 600m. Beyond this flatter section, the descent becomes extremely steep, and would be very tricky with sandstone terraces hidden from above if it wasn't for a clear path; as it is, it still requires care with some easy scrambling. There are superb views looking to the hidden side of Liathach. From the foot of the ridge keep heading down towards the Allt a Bhealaich, soon another path joins from the left at a cairn.\n\nThe path leads on down to reach a footbridge and then crosses this before descending the east bank, passing some waterfalls, before crossing the Abhainn Coire Mhic Nobuil on another footbridge. Continue on the excellent path down the east bank, which returns to the car park.",
