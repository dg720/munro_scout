    "description": "Park in layby 87, on the west side of the A9 about three quarters of a kilometre south of the Dalwhinnie turning. Cross the road (very carefully!) and head a short way along the verge to the north before going through a gate onto a vehicle track, passing under the pylons. and over the construction tracks for the new Beauly-Denny powerline. The hill track heads briefly north but soon bends to the right and begins to ascend the moor, with good views across the pass to A'Mharconaich and Geal Chàrn.\n\nContinue the easy ascent which keeps to the wide slope between two gullies. Nearing the plateau the track reaches an old quarry; the map is somewhat misleading in that this consists only of a shallow depression and a few blocks of quartz, and could be missed entirely when under snow. Continue on the track beyond the quarry, taking the left fork onto the broad ridge leading northeast. There is a line of fenceposts along here which may help navigation in mist. After a little under two kilometres the track is left as the ridge and fence bend to the right.\n\nA shallow depression is crossed before the final rise; this is very boggy underfoot unless it is frozen. Beyond, continue up the easy slope to the tiny cairn at the summit of Càrn na Caim. At 941 metres this is a Munro, and its position on the edge of the plateau makes it a good viewpoint. The dome of Meall Chuaich is in the foreground ahead, but the view extends across much of Badenoch to the Monadhliath, as well as across to the Cairngorms to the east and over range upon range to the west.\n\nReturn across the boggy bealach and back along the landrover track to where the plateau was initally reached, this time continuing south rather than returning to the 'quarry'. A track leads on at first, crossing a couple of dips in the plateau.\n\nBeyond the cairn on A'Buidheanach the plateau drops steeply, so it is better to bear left downhill a little before reaching this point to join a path skirting this lump. Another soggy bealach is crossed before a boggy path begins the ascent beyond, a little to the right of a small stream. The slope eases off as another plateau is reached, a short distance from the minor top of A'Buidheanach Mhor.\n\nHead southwest and then south for a short distance to reach the trig point of A'Buidheanach Bheag, the second Munro of the day at 936 metres. Truly dedicated baggers may notice on the map that there is a second summit at 936 about 500 metres to the west; it is impossible to say which is the true Munro summit but this second contender has no cairn and few visitors.\n\nOnce you are satisfied, return over all the bumps and dips back to the top of the landrover track near the 'quarry' for the easiest descent back to Drumochter."

    "description": "Park at the parking area just past the forestry plantations and gated, signed track off the A832 to the south west of Braemore junction. From the parking area walk back along the road for 20 metres until you reach the track leading to Loch a Bhraoin; it is signed for long distance routes to Kinlochewe and Loch Fannich. Go past the barrier and along the track, with views of the mountains ahead. Soon a gate is reached and new paths head off to the left and right - turn left here, following a path which leads through the forestry and then down to a bridge over the outflow of the loch.\n\nFollow the stalker's path on the other side of the bank for a very short distance. As you reach the foot of the ridge heading up to Tomain Coinich turn right onto a boggy path heading straight up the slope of Leitir Fhearna, the nose of the ridge. From here the slope higher up looks rocky but it presents no difficulties apart from wet ground; the path easily negotiates the rocky sections.\n\nOnce past the rocky part the ridge flattens and there is a plateau riven with peat gullies. Avoid the worst of the peat by following the path round the right edge to reach the grassier ridge beyond. This gives a gentle and enjoyable climb, with good views of the corries in front of the Munros on either side. Do not be tempted to stay on the path traversing the right hand side of the ridge, this path eventually leads to the col between Toman Coinich and A Chailleach across a very steep and rocky final slope; it is better to follow the crest of ridge straight to the summit of Toman Coinich.\n\nFrom the summit of Toman Coinich there are fine views down to Loch Fannich and the surrounding hills. Follow the south easterly broad ridge down to the col, crossing wide bare steps caused by glaciation in the last ice age. From the col it is a straightforward climb to Sgùrr Breac. The true summit is not the first cairn on the little rise but is a couple of hundred metres further east atop of flat plateau, giving little impression of the cliffs to the north. This is the first Munro of the day, at 1000 metres.\n\nRetrace your steps to Tomain Coinich and then descend the indistinct ridge to the bealach opposite before climbing steadily up the grassy and much more well defined and enjoyable ridge up the far side; there are great views down the cliffs on the right side down to Loch Toll an Lochain in the corrie floor.\n\nKeep following the ridge as it flattens off at the junction with Sròn an Goibhre ridge (most easily identified by the old fence post stumps going off down the slope to the right). Here bear left, following the path to reach the summit of A Chailleach, the second Munro of the day, and a superb viewpoint both over Loch Fannich and into the remote peaks of the Fisherfield Forest.\n\nTo find the descent route return north east to where the fence posts led off and start descending the ridge of Sròn na Goibhre (no path). The descent is fairly steep to start with and then becomes gentle as it follows the spur. The ridge climbs slightly, crossing a rocky-knoll like summit.\n\nA couple of hundred metres beyond these is the best place to begin the very steep descent down the right flank of the ridge to the coire near the outflow of Loch Toll an Lochain. The slope is mostly steep grass and bog with some greasy boulders, but must be tackled to avoid the crags at the termination of the ridge to the north. Once down in the corrie turn left alongside the burn, crossing it as soon as possible. Further on ground steepens and the stream cascades into a ravine with a series of waterfalls; this is negotiated with a descending traverse to the right.\n\nBeyond the waterfalls, continue heading downhill diagonally towards Loch a Bhraoin. Note a fine sheepfold off to the left. Eventually a very boggy and faint ATV track can be picked up, aiming for the far corner of a fenced area. Pass this corner and continue to the shores of Loch a' Bhroain. Now follow the very rough and boggy track back to the bridge at the outflow of the loch. Cross this to return to the A832 by the outward route."

    "description": "Park in the layby on the north side of the A87, just over a kilometre east of the Cluanie Inn. Walk east for a short distance along the road to the start of the signposted path through the An Caorann Mòr (about a kilometre and a half east of the Cluanie Inn). Walk up the first steep section of track; after around 50m look out for a faint path heading off on the right. From here the route makes an unrelenting and direct climb up the steep grassy slopes to the northeast. The angle relents at about 750m where you emerge on the south ridge of A'Chralaig.\n\nTurn left along the ridge, which climbs in stages and becomes better defined as height is gained. At about 1000m the ridge turns northwest and leads easily to the massive and well-built cairn on the summit of A' Chralaig (which rather puzzingly means The Basket). There is a commanding view of the whole area, with Loch Cluanie being seen full length. The ridge now briefly leads northwards before a steeper rocky descent northwest and a northerly continuation down to a bealacb.\n\nFrom the dip on the ridge, continue still with a clear path, crossing the 1008m top where it turns once more to the right to reach another col. From here the ridge goes north once more, and becomes very narrow. For part of the way the ridge crest is broken into a series of rocky towers; keen and able scramblers might cross these, but most walkers will use the clear bypass path which avoids them to the right before crossing back over the ridge and avoiding the last section to the left. Even the bypass path has one short rocky step but this shouldn't give most hillwalkers any difficulty.\n\nThe summit of Mullach Fraoch-Choire is a short distance beyond the difficulties. The second Munro of the day at 1102 metres has great views over the wilds at the head of Glen Affric though most walkers will most enjoy looking back along the ridge to A'Chralaig. From here, return back down the difficult section of ridge or bypass path, before leaving the ridge to the right at the col before the 1008 metre top. The descent is on a path down steep scree at first but the grassy upper reaches of Coire Odhar are soon reached.\n\nContinue the descent down Coire Odhar; it is possible to bear left slightly southwest lower down to shorten the walk back. The path through the Glen is reached at its foot; turn left along it and climb towards the low pass ahead. The pass itself is very boggy underfoot; aim for the start of the landrover track in the An Caorann Mòr which relieves the tedious going. Continue down this track to return to the start."
